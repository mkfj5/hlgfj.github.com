00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:03.120
The number of opponent moves would
actually do the opposite of what we

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.370
want.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.050
It would label boards as good where our
opponent has a large number of moves

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.770
when we actually want to isolate
them and prevent them from moving.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.935
Number of squares remaining doesn't
reflect the goodness of the board.

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:17.623
It's constantly decreasing
with each move.

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:22.155
Number of squares remaining minus number
of my moves would penalize our computer

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.639
player for boards with more potential
moves, which is counter productive.

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:29.515
Finally, number of my moves
minus number of opponent moves

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:33.490
is a good potential evaluation
function for isolation.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.120
It continues to take into account boards
where the current player can make

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.010
a larger number of moves and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.100
also penalizes boards where the opponent
can make a large number of moves.
