Waiting for a computer game
player to make a turn is no fun.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.910
After two seconds of waiting,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.060
a human player is likely to
start thinking of other things.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.560
We really need a way to
choose a move quickly.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.275
&gt;&gt; Well, we can't search to end game but
how can we search?

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:18.035
&gt;&gt; Let's assume again that we can search
ten to the ninth nodes per second.

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:22.195
So in two seconds we can actually search
two times ten to the ninth nodes.

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:25.635
So we need to solve the equation eight
to the X is less than two times ten

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:26.595
to the ninth.

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.285
We can do this by taking log
base eight on both sides.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:31.970
&gt;&gt; That log base eight
is pretty annoying.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.145
&gt;&gt; Yup,
time to bring out some old math skills.

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:41.170
We know that log A of X is equal to
the log B of X over the log B of A.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.340
So we can use that formula
to solve our problem.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.260
We'll use log base ten here for
convenience.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.626
So we end up with X is
less than log base ten

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:55.190
of two times ten to the ninth
over log base ten of eight.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.810
And we end up with X
being less than 10.3.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.840
&gt;&gt; So we should be okay if we
only search ten levels deep?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.959
&gt;&gt; Provided that our estimate of a
branching factor of eight on average is

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:05.140
good.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.460
To be on the safe side let's
only go to depth nine.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.800
This idea of only going as far as we
think we can to safely meet our deadline

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.200
is called a depth limited search.
