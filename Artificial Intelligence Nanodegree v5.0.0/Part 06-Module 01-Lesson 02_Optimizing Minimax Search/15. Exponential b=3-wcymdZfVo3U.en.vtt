00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.850
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.762
At level 0,
we have 1 node in the tree and

00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:08.105
iterative deepening has
only visited 1 node.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:11.007
At level 1 we now have
4 nodes in the tree.

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:15.136
Iterative deepening will have visited 5,
the 4 nodes in the tree now and

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:17.076
one node from the previous level.

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:19.618
At level 2,
we now have 13 nodes in the tree and

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:22.040
iterative deepening
will have visited 18.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.610
13 from this tree plus the 5
from the previous time.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.310
At level three we have 40 nodes

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.046
in the tree plus 18 makes 58 nodes
visited binder of deepening.

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:36.968
Finally, at level 4 we have
121 nodes in the tree,

00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:40.564
iterative deepening
we'll be visiting 179.

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:41.918
Which is actually less than one and

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:44.460
a half times the number
of nodes in the tree.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.872
Remember that before when
the [INAUDIBLE] factor of 2,

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:51.590
we had 2 to the d + 1
minus 1 nodes in the tree.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.050
Now with the project factor of three,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.090
we have 3 to the d + 1 minus
1 over 2 nodes in the tree.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.010
Let's go ahead and generalize this.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.660
For a project factor of k, the formulas
K to the d + 1- 1 over K- 1 for

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.550
the number of nodes in the tree.
