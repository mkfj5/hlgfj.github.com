00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.790
With the depth limit of two we get
a very different result than with

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.059
the limit of three.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; Yep, at level two,
the losing center moves.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.420
Both have scores of three, while
the winning moves have smaller scores.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.050
&gt;&gt; Does that mean our
evaluation function is bad?

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.440
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.050
It may mean that we're not searching
deep enough to get good answers.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.040
&gt;&gt; How do we tell?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.470
&gt;&gt; One way to check is to see which
branches the minimax algorithm

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.790
recommends at each level of the search.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.812
If the results vary widely
between certain levels,

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:32.740
it may be because critical a decision
is being made at those levels.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.537
Let's try it out on
the example isolation game.

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:39.241
We will continue to use the number
of my moves evaluation function.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:43.410
Which can have a maximum score of
five and a minimum score of zero.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.314
If we find a branch where
our computer player loses,

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:48.033
we'll give it a score of -1.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.926
If we find a branch where
our computer player wins,

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.823
we'll give it a score of 100.

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:56.753
With this example isolation game at
level one, the number of my moves

00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:01.990
evaluation function would recommend the
two center moves and the top left move.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.740
Each of these have scores of four.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.950
At Level 2,the two center moves are
considered the best with scores of 3.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.760
At Level 3,
the center moves are considered worse.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.458
That continues for Level 4, 5 and 6.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:22.398

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:25.590
After level three,
we've reach a state of quiescence.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.330
The recommended branches
are not changing much.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.612
We know we are in good shape.

00:01:29.612 --> 00:01:30.549
