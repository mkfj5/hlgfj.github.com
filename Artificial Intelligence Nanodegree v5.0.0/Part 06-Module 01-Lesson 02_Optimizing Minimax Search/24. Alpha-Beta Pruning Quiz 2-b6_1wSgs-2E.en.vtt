00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's consider the same
tree as the previous quiz.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.450
Is there a way to re-order the leaf
nodes of the tree in order to prune as

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.400
many nodes as possible?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.294
You'll find a link to the original
version in the instructor notes below

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:12.480
this video.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.771
Refer to that tree and fill in the
values here for your re-ordered tree.

00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:19.073
Then, go ahead and check the boxes
to indicate which nodes or

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:21.870
branches you can now
prune from the tree.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.390
Remember, you can enter
an exact value like five or

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.350
a range like greater than or
equal to five
