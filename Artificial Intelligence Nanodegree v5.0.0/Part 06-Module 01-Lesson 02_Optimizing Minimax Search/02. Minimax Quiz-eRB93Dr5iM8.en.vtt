00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.690
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.630
We'll start at the bottom and
propagate the bottoms up.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.770
The first level from
the bottom is a max level, so

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.650
we'll take the max of
each of our leaf nodes.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.260
Next, we have a min level, so

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.050
we'll take the min of each
of the values we just found.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.740
Finally, the top is the max level.
