00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.540
Now let's think about some other
potential evaluation functions for

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.960
isolation.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.728
Here we have some options.

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:08.600
Number of opponent_moves.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.514
So similar to the number of my_moves,

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:13.299
this is the number of moves
your opponent has available.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.100
Number of squares_remaining,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.066
which is the number of empty
squares left on the board.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.461
Number of squares_remaining
minus number of my_moves.

00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:25.830
And finally, we have number of my_moves
minus number of opponent-moves.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.010
So go through and mark all the formulas
you think that would make a good

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.970
evaluation function for isolation.
