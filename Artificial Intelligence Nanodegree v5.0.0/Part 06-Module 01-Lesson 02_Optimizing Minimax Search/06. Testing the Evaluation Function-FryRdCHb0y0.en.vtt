00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.160
The bottom level is easy to compute.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.876
It's just the number of moves
available to player O.

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:08.660
Then the second level from
the bottom is a max level.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.199
So, we take the max at each branch here.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.603
Then the top level of the subtree is
the min level and we end up with a 2.
