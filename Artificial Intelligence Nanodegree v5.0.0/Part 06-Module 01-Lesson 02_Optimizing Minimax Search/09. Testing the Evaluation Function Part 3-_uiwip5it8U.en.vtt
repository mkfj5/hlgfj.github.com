00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.270
Here are the values we get after
searching to level two of our game tree.

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:06.879
We can see that the values
are significantly different from when we

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:08.609
searched to level three.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.509
Previously, we would have chosen
one of these three nodes,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.640
because they received the highest
value in our evaluation function.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.789
But after only searching to level two, we
see that it's actually the other nodes

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.739
that get a higher value in
our evaluation function.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.070
So in this case our computer player
would choose one of these two moves.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.750
And if it takes the move on the left
first, it would choose this move, which

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.320
is a different choose than we would
have made after searching to level three.
