00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.880
Many problems in artificial intelligence
are exponential in time or space, or

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.090
both.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.240
In fact, NP hard problems are so

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.970
common in AI that researchers
joke half seriously

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.250
that AI is the study of finding
clever hacks to exponential problems.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.072
Often when a clever hacker is finally
found, or when computers finally get

00:00:21.072 --> 00:00:24.956
fast enough to address that particular
problem successfully, the world no

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:29.790
longer thinks of the problem as one
belonging to artificial intelligence.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.259
How many people think about the system

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.610
that helps consumers choose
plane flights as an AI?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.830
Or the system that helps determine
when to deploy an airbag on an SUV?

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.890
Yet at one point,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.000
these types of problems were
considered to be part of AI.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.230
That idea leads me to another
joke definition of AI.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.300
Artificial intelligence consists of all
the NP hard problems that have not yet

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.800
been solved.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.190
What matters to me are the problems
that the field of AI tackles.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.660
On the way here, I was practicing
this lecture with my taxi driver,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.080
Dilber, when I realized he was
using AI while we were talking.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.570
To get me to Udacity headquarters,
the navigation program on his smartphone

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.630
had plotted a path that was better
than the one I would have told him.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.160
And was communicating with him in a way
that he was getting the information

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.520
as he needed it.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.940
That is what is exciting about AI.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.060
You get a chance to work
on everyday problems

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.610
that can improve people's lives.
