00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.060
Here we can print this node right here.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.964
If we only knew the 11, this max
level here would be 11 or greater.

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:11.845
However, even if the value
was greater than 11,

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.800
the next node up would still take
the five senses of mean level.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.280
That means that we actually don't
need to check the four node

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.320
because it's irrelevant.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.550
And thus we can prune it from the tree.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.290
We can't prune any other nodes or
branches in this situation.
