00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.210
But that doesn't help us.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.924
&gt;&gt; Well, why not?

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.537
&gt;&gt; Well, the whole point of limiting
the depth of our search and

00:00:05.537 --> 00:00:08.612
using an evaluation function was to
avoid the exponential explosion in

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:10.780
the number of nodes we have to examine.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.170
With quiescence search we have to search
the game three for two levels and

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.729
maybe a whole lot more if the results
are changing between levels.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.170
&gt;&gt; Well, we don't have to use
quiescence search all the time.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.730
In fact, if we play isolation a lot and
see that the evaluation function

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.110
is giving us consistent results,
then we might not bother at all.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.250
However, we might find that in our
testing that certain times in the game

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.400
creates quiescent search might
give us some better results.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.440
Often times, that's at the beginning
of the game, or at the end of the game.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.290
Also we have another trick we can
use called iterative deepening, and

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.160
that might help us too.
