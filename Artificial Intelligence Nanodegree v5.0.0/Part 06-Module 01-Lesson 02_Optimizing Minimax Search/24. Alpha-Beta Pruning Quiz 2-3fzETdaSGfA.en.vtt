00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.649
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.310
We haven't made any changes to
the left side of the tree, so

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.769
as before,
the same 4 node will be pruned.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.019
On the right side, you can see that
we've switched the two branches.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.509
We evaluated this branch and got a 4, so

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.899
we know that in the min node above, our
value will be less than or equal to 4.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.320
However, the final
node is a max node and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.089
we already have a 5 to compare that to.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.870
So we'll always end up choosing
this 5 in the max node above.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.900
That means that the right most branches
are irrelevant and thus could be pruned.
