00:00:00.048 --> 00:00:01.290
And the solution is,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.844
let's look at different sequences in
which head occurs at least three times.

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:10.035
Could be head, head, head, head,
which in this case occurs four times.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:14.570
Could be head, head, head, tail,
and so on all the way to tail,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.530
head, head, head.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.650
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of those outcomes.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.112
Each of them has a 16th for
probability, so

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:28.580
it is 5 x 1/16, which is 0.3125.
