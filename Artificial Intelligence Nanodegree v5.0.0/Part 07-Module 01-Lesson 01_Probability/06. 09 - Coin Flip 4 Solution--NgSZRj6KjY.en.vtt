00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.774
And the answer is, well there's
two ways that we can achieve this.

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:05.237
One is the all heads, and one all tails.

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:08.288
You already know that
4 times heads is 1/16.

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:13.609
And we know that 4 times
tail is also 1/16.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.012
These are completely independent events.

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:19.968
So the probability of either
one occurring is 1/16

00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:24.934
+ 1/16, which is 1/8, which is 0.125.
