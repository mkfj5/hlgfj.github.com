00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.318
And the correct answer is 0.043.

00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:13.032
So, even though it received the positive
test my probability of having cancer is

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:19.960
just 4.3% which is not very much given
that the test itself is quite sensitive.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.010
It gives me a 0.8 chance of
Giving a negative result,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.100
if you don't have cancer it gives
me a .9 chance of detecting cancer,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.839
given that I have cancer.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.329
Now, how come this variable is so small?

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.549
Well, let's just put
all the cases together.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.829
You already know that we
received the positive tests.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.349
Therefore, this entry over here, and
this entry over here are relevant.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.430
Now, the chance of hitting
a positive test and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.927
hitting cancer is 0.009.

00:00:55.927 --> 00:01:00.544
Well, I might, when I receive a positive
test, have cancer, not cancer.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:06.007
So it is normalized by these
two possible causes for

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:11.719
the positive test which
is 0.009 + 0.198,

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.817
when I work these two things together,

00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:22.429
I get 0.009/0.207 is
approximately 0.043.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.320
But, the interesting thing in this
equation is that the chances of having

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.429
seen a positive test result in the
absence of cancers are still much, much

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.800
higher than just cancer seen in positive
result in the presence of cancer.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.390
That's because our prior for
cancer is so

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.460
small in the population, there's
just very unlikely to have cancer.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.129
So, the additional information
of a positive test

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.593
only raised my posterior
probability to 0.043.
