00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:03.883
The answer is 0.55.

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:07.758
The way to compute this is by
the theorem of [INAUDIBLE] probability.

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:14.719
Probability of X2=H, there are two
ways I can get to this outcome.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.179
One is via this path over here and
one is via this path over here.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:19.650
Let me just write both of them down.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.557
So first of all it could be
the probability of X2 equals

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:29.583
heads given that and
I'll assume X1 was head already.

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.745
And then now I have to add
the complimentary event.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:34.350
Suppose X1 came up tails.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.105
Then I can ask the question,

00:00:36.104 --> 00:00:39.771
what is the probability that
X2 come up heads regardless.

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.969
Even though X1 was tails?

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.104
Plugging in the numbers
gives us the following,

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.942
this one over here is 0.9, times a half.

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.917
The probability of tails is 0.8,

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:56.585
thereby my head probability
becomes 1 minus 0.8 which is 0.2.

00:00:56.585 --> 00:01:01.625
Adding all of this
together gives me 0.45

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:06.143
plus 0.1 which is exactly 0.55.
