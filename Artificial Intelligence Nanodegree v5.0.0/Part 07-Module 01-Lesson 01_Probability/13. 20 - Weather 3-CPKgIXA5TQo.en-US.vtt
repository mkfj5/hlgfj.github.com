00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.657
So what are the chances
that D2 is sunny?

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:06.819
Suppose the same dynamics
apply from D2 to D3.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.599
So just replace D3 over
here with D2s over here.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.599
That means the position probabilities
from one day to the next remain

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.769
the same.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.050
Tell me,
what's the probability that D3 is sunny?
