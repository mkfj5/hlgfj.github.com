00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.889
So the next units will be
concerned with probabilities.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.130
Particularly with restructured
probabilities using Bayes Networks.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.089
This is some of the most
involved material in this class.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.484
And, since this is
a Stanford level class,

00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:18.193
you'll find out that some of
the quizzes are actually really hard.

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:20.117
So, as you go through the material,

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:23.170
I hope the hardness of
the quizzes won't discourage you.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.619
It'll really entice you to take a piece
of paper and a pen and work them out.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.170
Let me give you a flavor of
a Bayes Network, using an example.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.069
Suppose you find in the morning
that your car won't start.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.243
Well, there's many causes why
your car might not start.

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:45.899
One is that your battery is flat.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.350
Even for a flat battery,
there's multiple causes.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.250
One, it's just plain dead.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.770
And one is that the battery is okay,
but it's not charging.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.240
The reason why a battery might
not charge is that the alternator

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.630
may be broken.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.910
Or the fan belt might be broken.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.000
If you look at this influence diagram,
also called a Bayes network,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.549
you'll find there's many different ways
to explain that the car won't start.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.870
And a natural question you might have
is, can we diagnose the problem?

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.837
One diagnostic tool is a battery meter.

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:19.165
Which may increase or

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:23.311
decrease your belief that the battery
may cause your car failure.

00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:25.780
You might also know your battery age.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.575
Older batteries tend
to go dead more often.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:33.689
And there's many other ways to look at
reasons why the car might not start.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.236
You might inspect the lights,
the oil light, the gas gauge.

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:40.661
You might even dip into the engine
to see what the oil level is with

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:41.370
a dipstick.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.552
And all of those relate to alternative
reasons to why the car might not be

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:45.510
starting.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.850
Like no oil, no gas,
the fuel line might be blocked, or

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.559
the starter may be broken.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.600
And all of these can influence your
measurements, like the oil light or

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.979
the gas gauge, in different ways.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.814
For example, the battery flat would
have an effect on the lights,

00:02:02.814 --> 00:02:07.030
it might in fact have an effect on
the oil light and on the gas gauge.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.842
But it won't really affect the oil
you measure with the dipstick,

00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:15.218
that is affected by the actual oil
level, which also affects the oil light.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.543
Gas will affect the gas gauge.

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:21.980
And of course,
without gas the car doesn't start.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.967
So this is a complicated structure
that really describes one

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:30.598
way to understand how
a car doesn't start.

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:31.977
A car is a complex system,

00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:36.070
there's lots of variables you
can't really measure immediately.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.390
And it has sensors,

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.915
which allow you to understand a little
bit about the state of the car.

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:47.165
What the Bayes Network does,
it really assists you in reasoning from

00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:53.139
observable variables like the car won't
start and the value of the dip stick,

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.234
to hidden causes like is the fan
belt broken or is the battery dead?

00:02:58.234 --> 00:03:02.260
What you have here is a Bayes Network.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.419
A Bayes Network is composed of nodes,

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:11.039
these nodes correspond to events
that you might or might not know.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.465
They're typically called
random variables.

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:17.759
These nodes are linked by arcs,
and the arcs suggest

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:23.409
that a child of an arc is
influenced by its parent.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.669
But not in a deterministic way, it might
be influenced in a probabilistic way.

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.789
Which means in order a battery,
for example,

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.390
has a higher chance of causing
the battery to be dead.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.259
But it's not clear that
every old battery is dead.

00:03:38.354 --> 00:03:42.979
There's a total of 16 variables
in this Bayes Network.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:48.389
What the graph structure and
associated probabilities specify is

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.678
a huge probability distribution in
the space of all of these 16 variables.

00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:59.956
If they are binary, which we will
assume throughout this unit,

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:04.012
they can take 2 to the 16
different values, which is a lot.

00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:06.537
The Bayes Network, as we find out,

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:10.832
is a complex representation of
a distribution over this very

00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:16.259
very large joint probability
distribution of all these variables.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.421
Further, once we specify
the Bayes Network,

00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:22.918
we can observe for example,
the car won't start.

00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:25.252
You can observe things like
the oil light, and the lights, and

00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:26.709
the battery meter.

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:31.000
And then compute probabilities of
hypothesis like the alternator is

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.639
broken, or the fan belt is broken,
or the battery is dead.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.038
So in this class, you're going to
talk about how to construct this

00:04:39.038 --> 00:04:41.895
Bayes Network, what the semantics are.

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:46.733
And how to reason in this Bayes Network
to find out about variables you

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:51.359
can't observe, like whether
the fan belt is broken or not.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.230
That's an overview.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.144
Throughout this unit, I'm going to
assume that every event is discrete,

00:04:57.144 --> 00:04:59.259
expect it's binary.

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.397
We'll start with some
consideration of basic probability.

00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:07.670
We work our way into some
simple Bayes Networks.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.730
We'll talk about concepts like
conditional independence.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.580
And then,
define Bayes Networks more generally.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:21.701
Move into concepts like D-separation and
start doing parameter counts.

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:25.109
Later on, Peter will tell you about
inference of Bayes Networks, so

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:27.579
we won't do this in this class.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:31.709
I can't over emphasize how
important this class is.

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:36.889
Bayes Networks are used extensively
in almost all fields of

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:42.219
smart computer systems,
in diagnostics, for prediction, for

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.980
machine learning, in a field like
finance, inside Google, in robotics.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.710
Bayes Networks are also the building
blocks of more advanced AI techniques,

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:58.799
such as particle filters,
hidden Markov models, MDP's and

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.730
POMDP's, Kalman filters,
and many others.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.530
These are words that don't sound
familiar quite yet, but as you go

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.699
through the class, I can promise you
you will get to know what they mean.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.009
So let's start now at the very,
very basics.
