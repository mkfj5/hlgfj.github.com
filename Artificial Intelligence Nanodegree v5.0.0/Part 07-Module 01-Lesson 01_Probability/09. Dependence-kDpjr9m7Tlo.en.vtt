00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.129
So let me ask you about dependence.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.320
Suppose we flip two coins.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.060
Our first coin is a fair coin.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.410
And we're going to denote
the outcome by X1.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.690
The chance of X1 coming
up heads is half.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.769
But now we branch into picking
a coin based on the first outcome.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.844
So if the first outcome was heads,

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:27.919
then you pick a coin with probability of
coming up heads, it's going to be 0.9.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.475
The way I wrote this is by
conditional probability,

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:35.829
the probability of the second coin
flip coming up heads, provided that,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.658
or given that, X1,
the first coin flip was heads, is 0.9.

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:43.835
Now, the first coin flip
might also come up tails,

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:46.359
in which case I pick
a very different coin.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.497
In this case, if I pick a coin,
which, with 0.1 probability, will

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:56.998
once again give me tails conditioned
on the first coin flip coming up tails.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.304
So my question for

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:03.539
you is what's the probability of
the second coin flip coming up heads?

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.989
