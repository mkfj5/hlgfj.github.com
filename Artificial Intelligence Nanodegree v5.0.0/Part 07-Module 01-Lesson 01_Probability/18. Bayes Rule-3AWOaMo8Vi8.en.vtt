00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.050
So you just learned about what's
probably the most important

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.009
piece of math with this task,
in statistics, called Bayes Rule.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:13.890
It's invented by Thomas Bayes,
who was a British mathematician and

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.740
a Presbyterian minister
in the 18th century.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.835
Bayes rule is usually stated as follows.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:25.251
P(A|B) where B is the evidence and

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:29.967
A is the variable we care about,

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:35.049
is P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.589
This expression is
called the Likelihood,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.550
this is called the Prior and
this is called the Marginal Likelihood.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.259
The expression over here
is called the posterior.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:52.589
The interesting thing is the way
the probabilities are reworded.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.140
Say we have evidence B.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.119
We know about B.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.879
But we really care about the variable A.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.320
So, example B is a test result.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.200
We don't care about the test
result as we much as we

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.865
care about the fact of whether
we have cancer or not.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:10.239
This diagnostic reasoning,

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:14.649
which is from evidence to its causes,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.008
is turned upside down by Bayes
rule into a causal reasoning,

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:25.399
which is given hypothetically
we knew the cause,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.810
what would be the probability of
the evidence we just observed.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.670
But to correct for this inversion
we have to multiply by the prior

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.475
of the cause to be the case in the first
place in this having cancel or

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:44.659
not, and divide it by the probability
of the evidence, POE.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.289
Which is often expanded using the field
of total probability as follows.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.739
The probability of B is the sum of all
the probabilities of the condition on a,

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.770
lower caps a,
times the probability of A=a.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.299
This is total probability.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.170
So let's apply this to the cancer case,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.930
and say we really care about whether
they have cancer, which is our cause

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.040
conditioned on the evidence that
is the result of this hidden cause.

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.419
In this case, the positive test result.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.509
Let's just plug in the numbers.

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:26.090
Our likelihood is the probability of
seeing a positive test result given

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.909
that they had cancer multiplied by the
prior probability of having cancer over

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.829
probability of the positive test
result and that is according to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.048
the tables we looked at before,
0.9 times a prior of 0.01 over.

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:49.448
Now we're going to expand
this variable here,

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:56.299
equal to the total probability
which gives us 0.9 times 0.01.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.240
It's the probability(+) given
that we do have cancer.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.388
So the probability of plus,
given that we don't have cancer,

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:12.219
is 0.2, but the prior is 0.99.

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.853
So if you plug in
the numbers we know about,

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:22.168
we get 0.009 / 0.009 + 0.198.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:27.194
Is approximately 0.0434

00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:33.151
which is the number we solved before.

00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:41.858
