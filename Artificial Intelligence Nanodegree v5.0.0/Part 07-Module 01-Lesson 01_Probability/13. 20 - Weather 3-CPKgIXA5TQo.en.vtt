00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.405
So, what are the chances that D2 is sunny?

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:06.950
Suppose the same dynamics apply from D2 to D3.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.350
So we'll just replace D3 over here with D2s over here.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.460
That means the transition probabilities from one day to the next remained the same.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.240
Tell me, what's the probability that D3 is sunny?
