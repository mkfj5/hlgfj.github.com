00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:04.939
So the correct answer here is 0.78 and

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.263
over here it's 0.756.

00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:15.730
To get there, let's complete this one
first, probability of D2 equals sunny.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.861
Well, we know there's a 0.9
chance it's sunny on D1 and

00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.484
then if it's sunny, that it would
stay sunny is a .0.8 chance.

00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:27.658
So we multiply these two
things together, we get 0.72.

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:31.592
We know there's 0.1 chance that it would
be rainy on D1 which is a compliment.

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:36.457
If it's rainy, we know it switches
to sunny with 0.6 chance,

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:40.449
so you multiply these two things,
you get 0.06.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.946
Adding those two up equals 0.78.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:50.597
Now for the next day,
we know our prior for sunniness is 0.78.

00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:54.460
If it is sunny,
it stays sunny with 0.8 probability.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.477
Multiplying these two
things gives us 0.624.

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:06.229
We know it's rainy with a 0.2 chance
because it's a compliment of 0.78.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.920
And a 0.6 it was sunny, so
you multiply those 0.132.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.579
Adding those two things
up gives us 0.756, so

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.269
to some extent it's tedious
to compute these values.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.429
But they can be perfectly
computed as shown here.
