00:00:00.065 --> 00:00:01.710
So we just learned a number of things.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.089
One is called complementary probability.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.169
If an event has certain probability, p,

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.141
the complementary event
has the probability 1-p.

00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:14.262
You also learned about independence.

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:17.330
If two variables, x and
y, are independent,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.469
you're going to write like this.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.210
That means the probability of
the joint that any two variables

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.597
can assume is the product
of the marginals.

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:31.477
So, rather than asking the question,
what is the probability for

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:35.634
any combination that is two coins,
or any five coins could have taken,

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:39.237
we can now look at the probability
of each coin individually,

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:42.179
doing its probability and
just multiply them up.
