Here's another quiz.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.500
What's the probability that
the coin comes up heads, heads,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.849
heads, three times in a row?

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.689
Assuming that each one of those
has the probability of a half, and

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.109
that these coin flips are independent.
