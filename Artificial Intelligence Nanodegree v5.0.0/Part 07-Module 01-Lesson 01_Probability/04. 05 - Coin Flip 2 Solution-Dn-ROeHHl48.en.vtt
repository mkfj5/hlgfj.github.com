00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.710
And the answer is three quarter,
it's a loaded coin.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.118
And the reason is either one could
come up with certain probability.

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:12.099
The total of those is 1,
the quarter is claimed by heads,

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.300
therefore three quarters remain for
tail, which is the answer over here.
