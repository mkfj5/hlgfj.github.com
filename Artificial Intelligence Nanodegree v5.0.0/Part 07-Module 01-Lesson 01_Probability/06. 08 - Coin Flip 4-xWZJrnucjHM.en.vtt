00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.270
Now let's flip the coin 4 times and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.140
let's call xi the result
of the i-th coin flip.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.109
So each xi is going to be
drawn from heads or tails.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:18.649
What's the probability that all four of
those flips gives us the same results

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.769
no matter what it is, assuming that
each one of those has an identity and

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.469
equal probability of coming up heads?
