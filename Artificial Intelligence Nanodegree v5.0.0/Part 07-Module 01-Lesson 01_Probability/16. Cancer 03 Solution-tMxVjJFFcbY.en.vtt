00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:06.347
And here the correct is 0.009
which is the product of

00:00:06.347 --> 00:00:12.004
the prior 0.01 times
the conditional 0.9.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:17.352
Over here we get 0.001 probability

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:21.446
of prior cancer times 0.1.

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:26.512
Over here you get 0.198,
probability of not having cancer is

00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:31.577
0.99 times still getting
a positive reading with is 0.2 and

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:37.275
finally we get 0.792 which is the
probability of this one over here and

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:38.829
this one over here.
