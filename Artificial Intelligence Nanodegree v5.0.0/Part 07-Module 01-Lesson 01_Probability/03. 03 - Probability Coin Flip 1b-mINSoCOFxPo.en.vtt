00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.446
So, the right answer is a half, 0.5,
and the reason is the coin can only

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:10.070
come up heads or tails,
we know that it has to be either one.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.095
Therefore, the total probability
of both coming up is 1.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.911
So, if half of the probability
is assigned to heads,

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:19.019
then the other half
is assigned to tails.

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.888
