00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.480
0.1 which is the difference
between 1 and 0.9.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.230
Let's assume the probability of the test

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.190
coming out positive even if we
don't have this cancer is 0.2.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:19.179
In other words, probability if it
is correctly saying you don't have

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.859
the cancer if you're cancer free is 0.8.
