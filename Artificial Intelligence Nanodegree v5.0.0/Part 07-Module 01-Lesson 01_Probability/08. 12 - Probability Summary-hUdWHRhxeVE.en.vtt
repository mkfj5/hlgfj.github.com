00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
So, we just learned a number of things,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.755
one is about complimentary probability.

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:08.460
If an event has certain probability P and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.130
the complimentary event has the probability 1-p. You also learned about independence.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.950
If two random variables X and Y are independent,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.390
you're going to write like this.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.110
That means the probability of the joint that any two variables can

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.250
assume is the product of the marginals.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.540
So rather than asking the question what is the probability

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.700
for any combination that these two coins of value five coins have taken,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.490
we can now look at the probability of each coin individually

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.230
due to it's probability and let's multiply them up.
