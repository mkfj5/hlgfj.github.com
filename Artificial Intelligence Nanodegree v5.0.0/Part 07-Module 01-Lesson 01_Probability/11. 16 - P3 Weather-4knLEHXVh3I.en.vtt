00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.655
We assume there is some of them sunny days and some of them rainy days.

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.000
On day one which we're going to call D1,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.970
probability of sunny is 0.9.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.140
Then let's assume there is sunny day,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.115
for the sunny day with 0.8 chance,

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:23.840
and a rainy day for the sunny day.
