00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.299
Now ultimately I'd like to go what's
the probability I have this cancer,

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.769
given that I've just received
a single positive test.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.980
Before I do this, please help me

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.179
filing out some other probabilities
that are actually important.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.989
Specifically, the joint probabilities.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.699
The probability of a positive test and
having cancer.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.673
The probability of a negative test and
having cancer, and

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:33.269
this is not a conditional any more,
it's a joint probability.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.900
So please give me those
four values over here
