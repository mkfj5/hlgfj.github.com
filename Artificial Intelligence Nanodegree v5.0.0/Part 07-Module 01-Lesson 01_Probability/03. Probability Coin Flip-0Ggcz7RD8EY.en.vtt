00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.076
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.718
So let's start with probabilities.

00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:15.750
Probabilities are the cornerstone
of artificial intelligence, and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.940
they are used to express uncertainty.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.532
And the management of uncertainty is
really key to many, many things in AI,

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:27.911
such as machine learning and
Bayes network inference, and filtering,

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:30.735
and robotics, and
computer vision and so on.

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:33.868
So let's start with some
very basic questions, and

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:36.298
we're going to work
our way up from there.

00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:37.094
Here's a coin.

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.557
The coin can have heads or tails.

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:41.295
And my question is the following.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:46.533
Suppose the probability for
heads is 0.5.

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.649
What's the probability for
it coming up tails?
