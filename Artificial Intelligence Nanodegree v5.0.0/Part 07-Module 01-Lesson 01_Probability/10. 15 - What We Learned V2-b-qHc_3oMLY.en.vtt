00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.560
So we actually just learned
some interesting lessons.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.359
Probability of any random variable y
can be written as probability of Y,

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:14.050
given that some other random variable,
X assumes value i, times probability

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.810
of X equals i, summed over all possible
outcomes i, for the random variable X.

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.001
This is called Total Probability.

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.105
The second thing we learned has to
do with negation of probabilities.

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:31.059
We found that probability of not x given

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.871
y is 1 minus probability of X given Y.

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:41.937
Now, you might be tempted to say what
about the probability of X given not Y?

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:49.546
Is this the same as 1 minus
probability of X given Y?

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:54.209
And the answer is absolutely no,
it's not the case.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.649
If you condition on something that
has a certain probability value,

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.530
you can take the event you're
looking at and negate this.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.792
But you can never negate
your position variable and

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.483
assume that these values add up to 1.
