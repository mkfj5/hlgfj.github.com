00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:04.072
Let's assume there's a test for
this cancer, which I'll give those

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:07.798
probabilistically an answer whether
we have this cancer or not.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.826
So let's say, the probability of
a test being positive is indicated

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:17.172
by this plus sign,
given that we have a cancer, is 0.9.

00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:21.699
Probability of the test coming
out negative if we have

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.920
the cancer is you name it.
