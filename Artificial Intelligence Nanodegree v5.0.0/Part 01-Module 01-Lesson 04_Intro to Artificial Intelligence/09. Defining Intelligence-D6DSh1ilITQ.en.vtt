00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.760
What if I was not human and
still behaved the way I did?

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.629
Would you still consider me intelligent?

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.839
&gt;&gt; You know actually you're right, I
wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.565
&gt;&gt; Then perhaps there are certain
qualities of systems,

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.519
both artificial and biological that we
ascribe the notion of intelligence to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.160
&gt;&gt; You know in my career,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.969
teaching artificial intelligence, I find
something kind of interesting emerges.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:24.839
We often tend to use the word
intelligence to describe things that we

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.679
don't know how to explain.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.980
Once we can explain them, we just say
that they're algorithms or formulas.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.929
They're only intelligent
if we can't explain them.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.240
But I think that
definition is problematic.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.010
First it implies that anything we
design can never be intelligent

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.189
because we would know how it works.

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:43.509
It throws AI right out the window.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.980
Also, we consider ourselves
intelligent because right now

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.303
we don't fully understand
how our brains work.

00:00:50.304 --> 00:00:54.870
One day thou if we do will we not
consider ourselves intelligent anymore?

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:57.699
And for philosophy that's
a fine definition to have.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.160
But for AI to be productive

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.689
our notion of intelligence must not be
contingent on how we perceive something.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:08.250
Rather it should be a property that
emerges out of the system itself.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.489
&gt;&gt; Good point.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:13.209
We often think of intelligence as
the ability to accomplish a variety of

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.449
intellectual tasks just like humans do.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.000
A subfield of AI called
artificial general intelligence

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.969
deals with this specific goal.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.109
But we are far from replicating
the complex nature of human thinking.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.319
Equating intelligence with human
behavior will pretty much rule out

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.289
all artificial systems.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.590
Besides, even humans are not
great at all kinds of tasks.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.590
&gt;&gt; Yes, intelligence should be
defined within the context of a task.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.180
For example,
if my goal is to solve Sudoku puzzles,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.830
and I'm able to do it with
a decent rate of success.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.510
Then I can say I am intelligent
at solving Sudoku puzzles.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.150
It just turns out that
humans are intelligent

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.780
at doing a lot of different things.
