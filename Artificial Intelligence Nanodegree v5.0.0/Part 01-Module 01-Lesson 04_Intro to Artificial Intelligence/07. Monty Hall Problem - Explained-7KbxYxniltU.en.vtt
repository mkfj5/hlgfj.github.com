00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.949
To help us understand this phenomenon
we'll take the help of an old friend,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.610
probability theory.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.929
It gives us a formal mechanism to
capture uncertainty in the real world.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.929
And let's us make sensible decisions,

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.030
even when we are not fully
sure about something.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.740
&gt;&gt; Since the assignment of cars and

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.489
goats is random, it doesn't really
matter which one we pick first.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.949
The chances that car is
behind one of these doors

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.160
is the same as the chances that is
behind either of the other two.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.109
&gt;&gt; We represent this by saying that the
probability of the car being behind door

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.909
A, which we denote by P(CarA), is equal
to P(CarB) and that is equal to P(CarC).

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.679
Also, we know that one of these
doors surely has the car behind it.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:43.490
And by convention,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.760
the probability of something that is
certainly true is set equal to 1.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.920
Therefore, we can say that the sum
of these probabilities equals 1.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.590
&gt;&gt; From these two statements,
we can conclude that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.950
each of these doors has a one-third
probability of the car been behind it.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.410
This is known as prior probability.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.450
Which is essentially our best
guess given no further evidence.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.149
Now let's say we now pick
door A as our first choice.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.480
&gt;&gt; Monty then opens one of
the other two doors, say B,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.210
to reveal a goat, which clearly implies
that door B does not have the car.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.329
Here, open B is
an observation we just made.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.739
And the expression, P(CarB) | OpenB,
is known as the posterior probability.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:30.219
That is our belief after
incorporating an observation, and

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.980
in this case it is 0.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.130
Now, one way to think about this is
that we have two doors left undisclosed.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:40.289
So the probability of the car
being behind either one of them

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.570
should be equal to half, right?

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.412
&gt;&gt; Wrong, you glossed over the fact
that Monty knowingly open the door with

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:47.950
a goat behind it.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.445
He would never reveal
the car at this stage.

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.533
&gt;&gt; Ah-ha, so we are actually
interested in finding out the posterior

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:58.906
probability of the car being behind
door C, given Monty opened door B and

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:02.570
the implicit rule that he
would never reveal the car.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.779
&gt;&gt; Correct, we can express this
posterior probability in terms of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.729
other quantities that we can
compute using Bayes' Theorem.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.080
Here, the first term, P(OpenB) | CarC,
known as the likelihood, must be 1.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.090
Because if the car is behind door C,
Monty's only option is to open B,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.030
since we already picked A.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.300
The second term, P(CarC),

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.160
is simply the prior, which we
already computed to be one-third.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.539
&gt;&gt; And the last term,
known as marginal probability,

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.650
is a little tricky to compute.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.420
There are three possibilities
we have to consider.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.239
The car could be behind door A which
happens one-third of the time.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.930
And in this case, Monty could open
either of B or C with equal probability.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.949
Therefore, P(OpenB) |
CarA would be half.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.090
Note that Monty cannot open door A as
we've picked it as our first choice.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.579
Or, the car could be behind door B,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.030
which also happens
one-third of the time.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.909
But in this case,
Monty will certainly not reveal it,

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.810
therefore P(OpenB) | CarB is 0.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.710
Finally, the car could be behind door C,
also one-third of the time.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.760
In which case Monty is
forced to open door B.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.043
Hence, P(OpenB) | CarC is 1.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.210
&gt;&gt; Let's plug these values back
into our Bayes' rule formulation.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.400
As we can see, the probability that
it is behind the other closed door

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.030
has increased to two-thirds.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.164
And even empirical evaluation indicates
that a consistent switch strategy wins

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:36.840
two-thirds of the time.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.793
&gt;&gt; It is fascinating how a careful
characterization of a given situation,

00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:42.542
combined with a formal method,

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:45.801
can help us make decisions even
in the face of uncertainty.
