00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.280
Okay, let's get back to our
question of what is intelligence?

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.740
Given these building blocks, agent,
environment, perception, action, and

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.310
cognition, is there a more practical
definition that we can come up with?

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.570
&gt;&gt; Well here's one formulation that's
actually quite widely accepted.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.690
An intelligent agent is one that takes
actions to maximize its expected utility

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.720
given a desired goal.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:27.059
This is commonly referred
to as rational behavior and

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.640
it let's us compare agents regardless
of what cognitive mechanisms they use.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.399
&gt;&gt; There is one problem with
this definition though.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.579
It requires agents to behave optimally.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.549
However as we have seen, it's extremely
hard to find the optimal solution

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.309
to many of the problems
we are concerned with.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.490
We need to consider the constraints
the agent is faced with.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.190
For example,
a partially observable environment,

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:54.179
limited computational resources such
as memory and processing speed.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.820
Rules imposed by the task at hand
such as having to respond by a given

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.549
deadline, etc.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.390
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.549
Given these constraints,

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.319
we can not expect an agent
to always behave optimally.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.780
Be we can come up with
a level of performance or

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.349
bound that we desire the agent to meet.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.239
So for example we might want
a chess playing program to win

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.119
at least 60% of the time
against human chess masters.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.859
Or a route finding algorithm
to always find a route.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.579
It is no more than two miles
longer than the optimal route.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.469
This is known as bounded optimality and
it serves as a practical and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.730
feasible way of
quantifying intelligence.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
