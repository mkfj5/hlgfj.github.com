00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.910
An agent interacts with the environment
by sensing its properties.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.589
This is known as perception and
by producing useful output or

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
actions that typically change
the state of the environment.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.669
The process by which an agent
decides what action to take

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.129
based on its perceived
inputs is called cognition.

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:22.589
Much of our discussion of AI will focus
on cognition, especially reasoning and

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.839
decision making.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.109
Perception and action become more
relevant in systems that react with

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.669
the real world, such as robots and
self-driving cars.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.429
&gt;&gt; Now some agents directly associate
their actions with what is perceived or

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.197
have very simple
pre-programmed behaviors.

00:00:36.197 --> 00:00:39.631
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Like an automated
trashcan that opens when

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.148
it senses something in front of it.

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:46.030
&gt;&gt; These are referred to as,
reactive or behavior based agents.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.310
Now it's possible to accomplish
surprisingly complex behavior

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.859
by layering simple reactive
control in a hierarchy.

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.454
Now, on the other end of the spectrum,
some agents are more deliberate and

00:00:56.454 --> 00:01:00.289
perform some non trivial processing
such as game playing agents, or

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.689
path planners.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:05.030
We can further classify these agents
depending on the kind of processing they

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.219
do like knowledge based agents, planning
agents, learning agents, and so on.
