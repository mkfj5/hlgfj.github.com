00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.242
This conversation reminds me of a game
show that has a very interesting and

00:00:04.242 --> 00:00:05.960
non intuitive problem
associated with it.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.689
&gt;&gt; Are you thinking
the Monty Hall problem?

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.109
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.480
You're shown three doors,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.339
behind one of them is a shiny new car,
while the other two have a goat.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.660
These are randomly assigned so
you don't know which is which.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.050
You're asked to pick one door,
then the host, Monty Hall,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.350
opens one of the other two
doors to reveal a goat.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.100
Note that Monty never opens
the door with the car behind it.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.685
Now, you can choose to either stay or
switch to the other closed door.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:37.440
Monty then reveals what is behind
the door you decided to go with.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:41.719
If you stayed with your original door
and the car is behind it, then you win.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.530
Similarly, if you switch
to the other door and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.320
the car is behind that one, you win.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.850
Ending up with a goat
is considered a loss.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.359
&gt;&gt; Now the question is, which is better
overall strategy, stay or switch?

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.579
Or is it the case that
neither is clearly better?
