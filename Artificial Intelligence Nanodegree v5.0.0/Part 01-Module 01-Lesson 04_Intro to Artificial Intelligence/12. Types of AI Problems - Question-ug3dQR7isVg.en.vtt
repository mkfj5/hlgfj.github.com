00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.770
One way to classify AI problems is
using properties of the environment and

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:07.479
components of state that
need to be captured.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.500
&gt;&gt; An environment can be fully
observable like Tic-Tac-Toe

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.230
where you can see the entire board.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.780
Or could be partially
observable like in Battleship

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.820
where you can't see your
opponents ship positions.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.449
&gt;&gt; An environment can be
deterministic where you know for

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.439
sure the results of each action.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.460
Or stochastic where
there is uncertainty.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.410
&gt;&gt; An environment can be discrete when 
thereâ€™s a finite number of states

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.030
that the environment can be in.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.429
Or can be continuous where the number
of possible states is infinite

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.439
typically due to some properties that
need to be stored as real numbers.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:41.519
&gt;&gt; An environment could be benign where
the agent is the only one taking actions

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.394
that intentionally affect its goal,

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:46.439
there could be other
random events going on.

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:48.659
Or adversarial where there are one or

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.849
more other agents that can take
actions to defeat its goal.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.359
Such environments are commonly
found in competitive games.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.679
&gt;&gt; Now for
each of the problem listed below,

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.890
can you mark the appropriate
characteristics?
