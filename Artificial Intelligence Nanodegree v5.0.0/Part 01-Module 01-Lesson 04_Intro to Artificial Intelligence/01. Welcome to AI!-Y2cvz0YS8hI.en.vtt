Hi, and
welcome to Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.139
I'm David Joyner.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:05.830
&gt;&gt; And I'm Arpan.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.650
We're here to get you started
on this exciting subject.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.050
AI has been a cornerstone
in my research,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.760
from cognitive modelling
to robotics challenges.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.143
In my PhD,
I focused on computer vision, and

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:20.179
how it is used by intelligent
agents to accomplish visual tasks.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.899
&gt;&gt; On the other hand, my work in
artificial intelligence has been more

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:24.939
about using AI as a means to an end.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.840
I'm interested in creating scalable
personalized educational experiences and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.240
one great way to do that is to build
AI agents that work as tutors.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.390
They build a model of student ability
and use it to inform the guidance and

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.505
the feedback and
that they give over time.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:43.975
While Arpan is interested in studying AI
itself, I'm interested in AI as a tool.

00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:48.564
&gt;&gt; In this nano degree program, you will
learn to apply the core concepts and

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:51.879
techniques used in artificial
intelligence from problem solving

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.240
using search, to logic,
planning, and probability.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.219
&gt;&gt; Along the way,
you'll be given challenging,

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.219
yet fun AI problems to
solve in each domain.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.429
Once you've demonstrated mastery of
these fundamental topics, you'll be able

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.930
to choose an area of concentration
to study in further detail, and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.770
use as the basis for
your Capstone project.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.719
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the skills you will learn
with us can help you build a career in

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.310
artificial intelligence or a related
field such as machine learning or

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.609
data science.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:18.700
Numerous companies and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.870
research labs are trying to solve real
world problems using intelligence.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, AI is becoming more and
more common in products and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.162
services we use every day,
just take a look around.

00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:31.530
&gt;From self-driving cars,
to intelligent thermostats,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.079
to autonomous robots,
artificial intelligence is everywhere.
