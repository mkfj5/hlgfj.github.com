00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.609
Finding the shortest path on a map
is a very useful ability and

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:04.950
that heuristic is a nice trick.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.990
But it seems more like
an optimization problem to me.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.804
I'm not sure if I'd consider
that a sign of intelligence.

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:15.550
&gt;&gt; Mm, okay, how would you characterize
an intelligence system or agent?

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.540
&gt;&gt; Well,
unlike the route finding domain,

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.929
many real world problems require us to
react to changes to our environment.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.689
Maybe, changes caused by
things like other drivers.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.625
I would expect an intelligent agent to
be able to react to such changes and

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.245
maybe even anticipate them.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:34.755
&gt;&gt; Hm, what if we could adapt similar
search strategies to solve problems that

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.810
involve other agents?

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.640
&gt;&gt; Like, playing games?

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.579
Yea.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.039
&gt;&gt; I guess we've seen that before, and
there are lots of famous examples of AI

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.799
agents winning games
from Chess to Starcraft.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.619
&gt;&gt; Let's try to figure out
a way to implement them.
