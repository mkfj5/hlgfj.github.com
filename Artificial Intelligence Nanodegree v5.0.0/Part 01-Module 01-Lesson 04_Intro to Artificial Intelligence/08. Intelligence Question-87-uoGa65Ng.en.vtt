00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:03.279
Perhaps this is the true
goal of intelligence.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.230
To be able to produce reasonable
behavior while dealing with

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.540
different sources of complexity.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:09.209
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.460
But what exactly is intelligence then?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.530
&gt;&gt; Boy, okay,
let's look at some examples and

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.399
you tell me whether you consider
them as intelligent or not.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.179
How about a piece of rock?

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.289
Or a plant?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.460
How about a thermos?

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.362
Or Siri?

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:39.280
How about myself?
