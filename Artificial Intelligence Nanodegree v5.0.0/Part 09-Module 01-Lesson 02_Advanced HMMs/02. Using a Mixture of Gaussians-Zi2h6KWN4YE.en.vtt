00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.229
What if our output
probabilities aren't Gaussian?

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:04.660
&gt;&gt; Well according to
the central limit theorem,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.650
we should get Gaussians if enough
factors are affecting the data.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.080
&gt;&gt; But in practice sometimes the output
probabilities really are not Gaussian.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.120
It is not hard for them to be bimodal.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.189
&gt;&gt; You mean like this.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:14.689
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.960
&gt;&gt; Well then we can use
two Gaussians to model it.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.589
&gt;&gt; Basically using the mixture
of Gaussians technique.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.820
&gt;&gt; Yep, in theory we can model
anything with enough Gaussians.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.730
Look at this box car distribution.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.469
&gt;&gt; The more Gaussians we use
the closer we will model it, but

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:28.789
how many should we use?

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.679
&gt;&gt; That really depends on your data.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.840
Visualization really helps here.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.040
In practice I tend to limit
my mixtures to two or

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.439
three Gaussians,
otherwise it tends to over fit.
