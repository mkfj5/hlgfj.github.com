00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.580
Next, let's talk about increasing
the size of our vocabulary.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.040
&gt;&gt; Okay, I've selected some signs
we can use to start making phrases.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.449
But we're going to have to choose
topologies for each of them.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.059
&gt;&gt; Well, we've already chosen
topologies for I and we.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.179
What sign is next on your list?

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.684
&gt;&gt; Well, let's add, want

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:18.711
[BLANK_AUDIO].

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:20.679
How many states does
that look like to you?

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.370
&gt;&gt; Well it has the onset where you bring
your hands up, the actual motion for

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.980
the sign itself.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.780
And then you're dropping
your hands again.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.100
I would say three states.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.900
&gt;&gt; Well how about for, need?

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.724
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.850
&gt;&gt; That looks similar, so
I'd also use three states.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.530
&gt;&gt; Okay here's a trickier one.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.908
This is an example for
the sign for table.

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:39.696
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:42.530
But, hold on,
that was actually a poor example.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.950
There's a better example for table.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.769
&gt;&gt; So your hands go up and down twice?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.880
That seems like four
states in this case.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.740
&gt;&gt; Yep, but to make thing even more
interesting, here's another example.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.475
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.230
&gt;&gt; Hold on, that time you went up and
down three times.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.939
How many times is allowed?

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.539
&gt;&gt; Well, generally you'll see
the motion repeated twice.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.370
But if somebody's thinking
hard about what to say,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.730
they might repeat the motions,
stalling for time.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.590
It's sort of like an English
speaker saying or.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
how can we deal with that in an HMM?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.130
&gt;&gt; Well, I didn't say we always had
to go from left to right with an HMM

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:17.799
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.920
So we can actually make a loop in the
HMM, say from the third to the second

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.010
state, so that the motions can
be repeated any number of times.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.000
&gt;&gt; Yep, you got the idea.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.140
In practice,
we can try lots of different typologies,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.284
use cross-validation
with randomly selected,

00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:34.289
training-independent test sets
to settle on the best one.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.990
&gt;&gt; Another example of your,
try the simple thing first, strategy?

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:38.839
&gt;&gt; Exactly, but in this case,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.900
let's try the simple typology first and
only add states when necessary.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.750
Let's look at another issue.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.350
Here's an example for cat,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.289
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.468
And here's another example for cat

00:01:49.468 --> 00:01:50.676
[BLANK_AUDIO].

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:53.159
&gt;&gt; One is one-handed,
while the other is two-handed.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.100
I don't think we're going to solve
that with a simple typology trick.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.608
&gt;&gt; We could try just
a normal three-state HMM,

00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:03.109
then use a mixture of Gaussians to
help handle the probabilities we get.

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.849
&gt;&gt; But I think it makes more sense just
to recognize these as two different

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:06.469
signs.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:07.469
&gt;&gt; Well, how so?

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.960
&gt;&gt; Well we could train a model for
the first variation of the sign.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.491
We'll call it cat one.

00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.822
And we'll train a separate model for the
second variation and call it cat two.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:17.120
And then we recognize either cat one or

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.409
cat two, we'll just have
our recognizer output, cat.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.359
&gt;&gt; Yep, that should solve the problem.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.090
While this approach adds more
gestures to our vocabulary,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.800
it is often the approach that
results in highest accuracy,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.300
provided we have enough examples
to train all the variations.
