00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.718
Our hope in designing this program
was to create something that

00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:06.810
combined the very best
materials on offer.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.759
We wanted to deliver a class that was
better than anything any one person or

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.619
organization could do.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.155
So we've combined the very best
foundational information with exclusive

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:19.092
new material.

00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:23.623
We've also put together a team of the
best AI brains on the planet to act as

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.370
your guides.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.740
We are delighted, this program
features my friend Peter Norvig,

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.859
director of research at Google,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.409
who quite literally wrote the leading
textbook on artificial intelligence.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.479
We also meet my friend Thad Starner,
who's founder and director

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.899
of the Contextual Computing Group at
Georgia Tech's College of Computing and

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.049
a researcher at my very own Google X.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:50.359
In fact, much of the material in this
program is taught to computer science

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.909
master students around the world
including Stanford and Georgia Tech.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.369
I hope that gives you a sense of
the quality of the teaching here.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:04.159
Arpan Chakraborty and David Joyner, will
act as further guides on your journey.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.269
Arpan has a PhD in computer vision,

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:10.849
while David won Georgia Tech's
Lockheed Excellence Teaching Award and

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:14.479
has been lecturing in AI for
more than three years.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.555
And in the next few videos, Dhruv
Parthasarathy who focused on AI for

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.982
both his undergrad and
masters degree at MIT.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.978
And who is the director of
the AI Program here at Udacity,

00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:29.795
will give you a bird's eye
view of this new nanodegree.

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:31.890
You'll even see more of me again.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.123
So now, over to Dhruv who'll show you
what you built during this course.

00:01:37.123 --> 00:01:40.118
