00:00:00.285 --> 00:00:03.904
Hi, I'm Sebastian,
I'm delighted to welcome you to

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.926
Udacity's Artificial Intelligence
Nano Degree program.

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:12.064
We think it provides
an experience unlike any other.

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:16.623
AI is really about unleashing one of
the most amazing things in the entire

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:18.429
universe, intelligence.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.858
AI is growing exponentially.

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:26.435
And will change our world at a rate
that will far surpass changes wrought by humans,

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:30.429
because AIs can learn
much faster than us.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.728
Just look at self-driving cars.

00:00:32.728 --> 00:00:36.030
Anytime you drive,
only one person gets better.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.670
You.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.100
But with AI, anytime an AI car drives,
all cars get better,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.049
including all future unborn cars.

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.159
After completing this program, you'll
be positioned to take full advantage

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.844
of such changes that AI will usher in.

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:55.200
You will be ready to work with
trans-disciplinary thinkers and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.700
practitioners to create technologies
that will shape our future world.
