00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
Hi, welcome to the program.

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.129
We're thrilled to have you here and I'm looking forward to guiding

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.689
your journey through the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.879
You are now an essential member of the Udacity community.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.810
We're here to make sure you fulfill your goals,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.585
but we also want to learn from you.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:18.719
Your experience will guide future development and we would love to hear

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.294
your thoughts on how we can improve and make this program better for others.

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:23.680
Now, let's take a quick walk through

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.050
the Udacity office to get a flavor of how we do things here.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.115
So we believe in learning by doing.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:32.429
So rather than simply watching videos or taking tests on AI,

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.505
you'll build real artificial intelligence and watch those AIs,

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.980
solve complex problems that humans like me and

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.744
you simply can't do with the same speed or accuracy.

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.449
In the first project, you build

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.359
a simple AI agent that solves any Sudoku problem in the world.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.515
And learn two foundational AI techniques;

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:49.755
constraint propagation and search.

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:53.100
This project is just a little teaser to get your feet wet and show you how

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.880
quickly you can start applying AI concepts to problems around you. Hey Kristina?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.554
Hey Dhruv.

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:02.460
You will also been given the chance to go

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.920
above and beyond by using advanced Sudoku strategies,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.680
to improve the speed of your agent.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.100
In the next project, you'll build any AI agent

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:13.804
that can routinely defeat opponents in isolation.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.250
Here you apply minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.959
Two strategies used by Google world beating Go agent, AlphaGo.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:22.829
You go on to create an AI that guides Pac-Man through his maze and

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.030
allows him to eat all the food in the most efficient way possible.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.469
Definitely more efficient than Ryan over here.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.250
I'm still practicing.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.049
Using simple techniques such as;

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.105
breadth-first search, depth-first search and A-Star Search.

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:38.159
Your AI agent will traverse Pac-Man Maze faster than any human player.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.560
Next, you'll be tasked with finding the optimal route

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.500
for taking cargo from one place to another.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.640
Planning problems like this,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.820
are the very core of the logistics industry.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.614
And you'll see just how powerful AI is in solving these kind of problems.

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:56.039
And finally, you use hidden Markov models to automatically read

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.115
sign language characters and convert them into their English text counterparts.

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.640
This is just one of the many examples of how

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.665
AI is making a meaningful impact in society at large.

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:08.575
And, all this is just in timeline.

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:12.049
We think you'll have a lot of fun and we can't wait to see you get started.
