00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.706
You mean like this board?

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:06.277
&gt;&gt; Hold on, I have to think
about this one for a second.

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:10.390
Okay, I see that there's only one
current attack on this diagonal.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.160
So when I move one of these
queens I should be done.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.930
&gt;&gt; Sure, why not try it out?

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, well let's work with
the queen in the fourth column first.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.670
I can't put it in the topmost row,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.216
because it gets attacked by the same
queen as well as its diagonal neighbor.

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:31.800
With the next row down,
it's attacked both here and here.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.220
The next row down is
attacked both here and here.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.230
Hold it, there is no place on this board
I can put it without being attacked

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.310
horizontally.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.750
Except where I had it originally,
in fact,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.730
every possible spot
makes the problem worse.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.300
We'll cause more attacks.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.080
&gt;&gt; Is there anything else we could do?

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.647
&gt;&gt; We'll have the same problem with the
queen in the second to the last column.

00:00:55.647 --> 00:01:01.240
Moving it down one row leads
to two attacks, here and here.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.540
Going to the next row causes
two attacks, as well.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.860
Every single move with this queen
gets more attacks, as well.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.700
And moving any of the other six queens
will also cause an increase of attacks

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.900
because they will be
attacked horizontally,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.090
plus we will still have
the original attack.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.550
For example, look at this left
most queen, every row, except for

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.210
the one it's in,
currently will have another attack.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.710
&gt;&gt; Does that mean
the problem is unsolvable?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.450
&gt;&gt; No, I know the problem is solvable,
but I seem to be stuck.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.960
No one move will improve my situation,
this puzzle hurts my brain.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.650
&gt;&gt; Maybe we can use a simpler
problem to figure out a solution and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.480
then come back to this one later.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.390
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.
