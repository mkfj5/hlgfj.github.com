00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.282
Let's be a little more formal
about the n-Queens problems.

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:05.830
Given a current board we
want to make the one move

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.560
that can most greatly
improve the situation.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.620
In fact to simplify the discussion let's
constrain ourselves to moving a single

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.850
queen up or down within its column.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.468
Then we keep iterating until we reach
our goal of having zero attacks.

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:21.622
&gt;&gt; Given this board which
currently has 17 attacking pairs.

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:25.670
The best we can do with a single move is
to get the number of attacks down to 12.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.630
For example,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.620
if you move this queen here, you
reduce the number of conflicts to 12.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.620
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.870
But, how do we figure
out which one to take?

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.640
Do we just select it randomly?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.330
&gt;&gt; Seemed as good an idea as any.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.480
&gt;&gt; Okay so we can continue to iterate,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.322
hopefully reducing the number
of attacks with each move.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:45.710
But what if we get into a situation
where no move decreases our

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.670
number of attacks?
