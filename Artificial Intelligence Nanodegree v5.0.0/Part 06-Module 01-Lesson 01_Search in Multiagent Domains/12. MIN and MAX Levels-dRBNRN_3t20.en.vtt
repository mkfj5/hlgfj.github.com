00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.310
With terminal node in our game tree.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.540
With a +1 if our computer player
wins and a -1 if it loses.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.325
We've used squares to indicate
the terminal nodes and

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:13.394
put their scores inside them.

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:16.666
We are going to assume that our
opponent x is really smart and

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.640
will always play to win.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.630
In other words, we'll assume that
x will always minimize o's scores.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.500
While our computer player will
always try to maximize its scores.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
To show that idea, we are going to mark
the game tree with a triangle pointing

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.900
up to indicate turns when our computer
player is trying to maximize the score.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.760
The triangle pointing down when
the component is trying to minimize

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.850
the score.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.890
Since our computer
player is going first,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470
we start with the maximization level.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.999
In general, since we are only searching
from our computer player's perspective,

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.583
they can only affect the game
when it is its turn,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.631
the top of a minimax tree is
always going to be a max level.
