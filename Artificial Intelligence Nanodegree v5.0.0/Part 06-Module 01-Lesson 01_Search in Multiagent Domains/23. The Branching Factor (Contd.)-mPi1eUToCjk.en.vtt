00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.610
What if we do average
branching factor instead?

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.600
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good idea but,
how do we do that?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.930
&gt;&gt; Just try it out.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.760
&gt;&gt; Sure, why not?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720
I always say do the simple
thing first and

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.040
only add intelligence when necessary.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.065
Let's write a quick computer game
player that moves randomly and

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.604
just test see what our
branching factor is on average.

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:28.604
