00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.430
How many nodes do you think the Minimax
algorithm will need to visit

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.800
in the game tree?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.140
Here's some choices where b is
the average branching factor, and

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.650
d is the average depth.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.520
So we have bd, d to the power of b,
d squared, and b to the power of d.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.020
Pick what you think is the best answer.
