00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.689
In most situations in this game
tree our computer player O wins.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.620
But in a few situations,the game ends
with our opponent X winning at level

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.830
five.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.170
If our computer player
makes a poor choice for

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.309
its first move,
X can win no matter what O does.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
Clearly we never want our computer
player to make this bad first move.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.680
To avoid that situation we can keep
a table of best first moves for

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.520
this board configuration.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.160
This table to called an opening book,
similar tables can be kept for

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.220
end games.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.550
But how do we make discovering
these bad moves automatic?

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.950
Better yet how do we discover
the best moves for a computer player?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.880
The answer is the mini max algorithm,
a version of which we will see next.
