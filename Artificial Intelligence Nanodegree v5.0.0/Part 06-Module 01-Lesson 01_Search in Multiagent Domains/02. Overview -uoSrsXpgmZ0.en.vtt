00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.200
Your goal in this lesson is to design
an AI that is smarter than yourself.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.550
At least in playing a real game.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.140
Now granted,
a single game is a very limited context.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.211
But making a program that can play a
game better than you can is an exciting

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.426
introduction to AI.

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:18.110
It's the way I got hooked.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.710
I'm hoping to share my enthusiasm.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.520
Along the way,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.750
you will learn how to use adversarial
search to find optimal moves.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.228
In particular, we will talk
about the minimax algorithm and

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.814
alpha-beta pruning.

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:35.460
We'll also talk about how to create
evaluation functions for games.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.290
These ideas are enough to create
surprisingly powerful game AIs.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.810
We will apply our
knowledge to Isolation,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.370
a complex game with
surprisingly simple rules.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.540
We will then examine multi-player and
probabilistic games.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.570
As your assignment for this lesson, you
will need to create a game player for

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.060
Isolation.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.680
Note how long it takes you and
how difficult you find it.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.070
That should give you a sense
of the amount of time and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.900
effort that this course will require.
