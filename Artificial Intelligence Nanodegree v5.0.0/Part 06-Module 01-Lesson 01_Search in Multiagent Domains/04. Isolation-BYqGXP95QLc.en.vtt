00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.690
Let's dive in and
start with something fun.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.740
Let's teach you the rules of isolation,
the example game we will be using.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.429
Shelly and I will play a game of
isolation on a five by five board.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.209
I'll be O and move first.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.379
O gets to place its piece
anywhere on the game board.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.150
I'll choose here.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.770
Shelly will be X and she can place
her piece anywhere remaining.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.640
Shelly, where do you want to go?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.230
&gt;&gt; I'll go here.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.909
&gt;&gt; From now on,
our players move like queens in chess.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.630
For example, for my next move,
I can go any square that's horizontal or

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.770
vertical or diagonal from me except I
can't move through Shelly's piece here.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.070
I only have this diagonal move.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.310
&gt;&gt; Okay, I get how players move, but
do they attack each other like in chess?

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.950
What's the objective of the game?

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.510
&gt;&gt; The objective is to be
the last player to move.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.859
The players cannot go outside
the boundaries of the game board, nor

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.539
through a position that is currently,
or was previously occupied.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.839
The first player to get isolated, and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.730
by that I mean unable to
move on their turn, loses.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.329
For my next move I
think I will move here.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:08.209
&gt;&gt; Wait a second.

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.309
Why aren't the squares between the start
and the end position filled in?

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980
&gt;&gt; You mean these squares here?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.850
You're thinking about the game snake.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:18.119
In isolation it's just where you
land that becomes unobtainable for

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.280
future moves.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.400
&gt;&gt; Okay, in that case I'll move here.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.579
&gt;&gt; Great, now we have a game going.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.090
So let's see here.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.750
I want to go here and
limit your moves for the future.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.734
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Okay, so I'll go here.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:35.754
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:40.974
I think that what I'll do is try
to force an early end to the game.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:45.344
I'm going to do this and
start dividing up the board.

00:01:45.344 --> 00:01:49.155
&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's more spots filled
up on the right side of the board, so

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:52.480
I think I'll go towards the left so
I have more space to move in.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.350
Okay, that was a wise move.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.309
Let me actually go here and
see if I can trap you in.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.980
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So I'm going to keep going left and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.939
see if I can escape,
maybe get back onto the right side.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.590
&gt;&gt; Okay,
I want to prevent you from getting out.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.340
So I think I can do that, I think
I can actually win at this point.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.039
So I'm going to go here and
stop your diagonal move out.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.527
&gt;&gt; Hm, looks like I'm stuck.

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:19.629
[LAUGH] I guess I have
to try to get out.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.039
&gt;&gt; Yep, we're getting to end game
pretty quickly here because of that

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.409
immediate move where I
could partition the board.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.729
So I'll go up here, and now you're stuck
and now since you have no move, I win.

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:34.780
Yay!

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.460
Okay.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.070
So what we've shown here is the rules
of isolation and the game board.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.259
We've also shown some tricks that show
about the difficulty of the game and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.870
how you can early on create a partition
that divides the boards up into

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.140
one side the other and how you
often fight for the correct side.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.929
Strategy for
isolation is really quite complex.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.460
You'll find out pretty quickly when
you actually try do your homework.
