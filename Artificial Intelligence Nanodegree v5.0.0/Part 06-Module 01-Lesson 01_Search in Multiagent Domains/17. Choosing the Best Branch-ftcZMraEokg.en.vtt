Thanks, Shelly.

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.680
Now we can see that our computer
player loses in only two branches,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.070
assuming otherwise perfect play.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.530
All our computer player has to do is
choose any of the other branches and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.050
it will win.
