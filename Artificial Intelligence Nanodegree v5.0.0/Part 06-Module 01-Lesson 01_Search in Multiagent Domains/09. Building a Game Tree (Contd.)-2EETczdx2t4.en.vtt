00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.569
Let's keep expanding the nodes in
order until we have fully expanded

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.490
level three of our tree.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.009
As we see, some nodes have two children,
others have three.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.109
Even so, we see that the exponential
growth of the children makes it

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.269
increasingly difficult to display
the full tree on the screen at once.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.429
In level four it is x's turn.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.570
Again we expand the tree completely.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.679
Scrolling through the tree shows how
increasingly dense it is getting.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.044
Level five gets a bit more interesting.

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:35.127
In the leftmost branch
o has one final move.

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:38.050
However, in the next
branch x has blocked o in.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.300
O has no move and the game ends.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.009
To indicate that our computer
player has lost in this situation,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.049
we will mark this node with a -1.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.059
Expanding level five completely, we see
that one branch looks particularly dire

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.569
for our computer player,
as it has many losing situations.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.390
Even worse, the opponent has control
of the board at the level above.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.880
We have to find a way to
warn our computer player

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.900
from making a move that
leads to this branch.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.635
By level six there are no moves
left anywhere on the board.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.055
All games have ended.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.665
The ones where o wins
we will mark with a +1.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:20.334
The ones where o lost on level five,
we've already marked with a -1.

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:24.447
Now that we have seen all the possible
futures of the game, we'll back

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:29.204
propagate this knowledge to our computer
player so we can make a wise first move.
