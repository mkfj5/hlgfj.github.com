00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.200
While the center position has
16 spaces in which it can move,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.640
most other positions have 12 or less.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.200
As the game plays, we will have less and
less spaces our player can move.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.840
&gt;&gt; That means we can make a better
estimate on how many nodes we have

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.430
right?

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.254
&gt;&gt; Yep, okay, we know we cannot
have more than 25 moves in a game.

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:20.655
That is the maximum depth
our tree is going to be.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:24.025
And we already know how many moves
can be done in the beginning,

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:26.297
which leaves 23 moves left.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.097
We know that each move after the first
two are generally going to have 12 or

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.807
fewer moves available.

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:33.957
We'll call this the branching factor.

00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:35.817
In worse case,

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:41.410
we can expect 25 times 24 times 12 to
the 23rd n nodes in our game tree.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.920
Shelly, how many is that?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.608
&gt;&gt; More than 10 to the 27th power.

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:48.290
&gt;&gt; Ouch, okay that really didn't help.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.660
Perhaps we can improve
our estimate more.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.860
&gt;&gt; Well, we know at the end of the game
there have to be progressively fewer

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.970
moves available.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.020
There are zero moves in the end,
one move before that,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.850
a maximum of two before that,
three before that, and so on.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.560
&gt;&gt; You're right.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.960
So for the last few moves, assuming a
branching factor of 12 is way too much.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.613
That would be around
10 to the 13th nodes.

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:13.226
But the maximum it could
be is 12 factorial,

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:16.010
or about 5 times 10 to the 8th.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.693
I guess we could redo our estimate as
25 times 24 times 13 12s in a row,

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:24.064
times 5 times 10 to the 8th.

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:28.060
That's approximately equal
to 3 times 10 to the 23rd.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.481
That is better than 10 to the 25th, or

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.870
the 10 to the 27th, but
still seems like a gross overestimate

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.840
as most branches will have much less
than the maximum branching factor.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.000
&gt;&gt; Let's see if the students
have a better answer than we do.
