00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.930
Now let's use a simple two by three
version of isolation to illustrate how

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.100
to make a game tree that shows all
the moves possible during a game.

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:10.962
We will use this game tree to select
moves which give the best guarantee

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:12.200
of winning.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.822
Consider any field spot on
the game board as unavailable.

00:00:14.822 --> 00:00:17.793
We will start with one field spot.

00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:20.970
We'll call the beginning game
level zero in our game tree.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.270
Assume that O is the computer player.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.580
O is the first to move, so the computer
has five choices in the beginning.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.880
We draw out all the possible boards for
level one of the game tree.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.000
X goes next and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.470
can put its piece anywhere on the game
board that has not been taken by O.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.100
So no matter which position O occupied
for its first move, X has four choices.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.180
We can quickly draw the nodes for
level two of our tree.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.950
&gt;From then on, the number of choices for
each player becomes smaller

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.610
as the pieces are limited to
moves like a queen in chess.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.992
O goes next.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:58.485
To the left most leaf,
O can move straight down.

00:00:58.485 --> 00:00:59.930
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.410
Diagonally down to the right.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.250
But it can't move through X.
