can move like a queen in chess, but

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.450
can not pass through positions
that have been previously played.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.700
Also, when a piece is moved it doesn't
leave a trail like the game snake, but

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.560
just the last position
is marked as impassable.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.421
So here are those resulting child nodes.

00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:16.389
