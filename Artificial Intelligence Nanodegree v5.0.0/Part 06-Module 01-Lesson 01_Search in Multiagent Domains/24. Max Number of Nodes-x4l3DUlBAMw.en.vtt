00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.870
Okay, after playing with five
by five isolation for a bit.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.345
The average branching
factor seems to be about 8.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.500
So we now get an estimate
of 8 to the 25th nodes.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.345
&gt;&gt; That's about 10 to the 22nd nodes.

00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:17.345
&gt;&gt; Great,
that means we only have to wait for

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:20.605
around 1.2 million years
to get our answer.

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.566
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
you're not going to be alive by then.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:26.910
&gt;&gt; Them dang kids, no good
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.100
&gt;&gt; No problem.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.080
That means we need to be more clever
about how we make a computer player for

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.210
isolation.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.290
The exponential growth of the game
tree means we can't brute force

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.840
the problem and search for
the end-game easily.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.530
In general, more interesting games
will not be searchable til the end.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.380
Either the branching factor is
too large, or the depth, or both.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.600
When the number of nodes,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.580
which we can estimate by branching
factor to the depth power.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.490
Starts becoming comparable to the number
of seconds remaining in the life of

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.510
the universe.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.503
We know we are in trouble.
