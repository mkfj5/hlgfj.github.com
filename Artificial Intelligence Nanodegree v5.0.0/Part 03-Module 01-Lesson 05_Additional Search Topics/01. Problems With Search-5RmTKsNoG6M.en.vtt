00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.504
We've seen what search can do for
problem solving.

00:00:02.504 --> 00:00:06.887
It can find the lowest cost path
to a goal and it can do that in

00:00:06.887 --> 00:00:11.277
a way in which we never generate
more paths than we have to.

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:14.246
We can find the optimal number
of paths to generate and

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.481
we can do that with a heuristic
function that we generate on

00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:20.770
our own by relaxing the existing
problem definition.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.539
But let's be clear on
what search can't do.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.579
All the solutions that we have found
consist of a fixed sequence of actions.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.408
In other words,
the agent here in Arad thinks,

00:00:32.408 --> 00:00:35.149
comes up with a plan
that it wants to execute.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.890
And then essentially closes his eyes and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.630
starts driving, never considering along
the way if something has gone wrong.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.870
And that works fine for
this type of problem, but

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:48.714
it only works when we satisfy
the following conditions.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:53.480
Problem-solving technology works when
the following set of conditions is true.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.390
First, the domain must
be fully observable.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.079
In other words, we must be able to see
what initial state we start out with.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.480
Second, the domain must be known.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.500
That is, we have to know the set
of available actions to us.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.799
And third, the domain must be discrete.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.349
There must be a finite number
of actions to choose from.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:17.289
Fourth, the domain
must be deterministic.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.440
We have to know the result
of taking an action.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.769
And finally, domain must be static.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:26.390
There must be nothing else in
the world that can change the world

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.000
except our own actions.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.700
If all these conditions are true,
then we can search for

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.890
a plan which solves the problem and
is guaranteed to work.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.799
In later units, we will see what to do
if any of these conditions fail to hold.
