00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
Now, for a little more terminology.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.120
We say that a valid sentence is one that is

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.190
true in every possible model for

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.250
every combination of values of the propositional symbols,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.360
and a satisfiable sentence is one

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.470
that is true in some model and not necessarily in all the models.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.965
So what I want you to do is tell me,

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:24.855
for each of these sentences,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.483
whether it is valid,

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:32.214
satisfiable but not valid, or unsatisfiable.

00:00:32.214 --> 00:00:34.770
In other words, false for all models.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.660
And the sentences are,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.400
P or not P,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.545
P and not P, P or Q,

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:46.020
or P is equivalent to Q,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.365
P implies Q, or Q implies P,

00:00:50.365 --> 00:00:53.400
and finally, food implies party,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.160
or drinks implies party,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.270
implies food and drinks implies party.
