00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.450
Here are the truth tables for
all the logical connectives.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.160
What a truth table does is
list all the possibilities for

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.070
the propositional symbols.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.890
So P and Q can be false and false,
false and true, true and false, or

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.999
true and true.

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.810
Those are the only four possibilities.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.359
And then for
each of those possibilities,

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.559
the truth table lists the truth
value of the compound sentence.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:30.119
So the sentence not P is true when P
is false and false when P is true.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.670
The sentence P and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.620
Q is true only when both P and
Q are true and false otherwise.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:44.021
The sentence P or
Q is true when either P or

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:48.561
Q is true, and
false when both are false.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:53.051
Now so far, those mostly correspond
to the English meaning of those

00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.197
sentences with one exception.

00:00:55.197 --> 00:00:58.797
Which is that in English, the word or

00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:03.559
is somewhat ambiguous
between the inclusive and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.103
exclusive or and this or
means either or both.

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:15.217
We translate this mark into English
as P implies Q or as if P then Q.

00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:18.405
But the meaning in logic is not quite
the same as the meaning in ordinary

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:19.367
English.

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:24.239
The meaning in logic is defined
explicitly by this truth table and

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:25.469
by nothing else.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.689
But let's look at some
examples in ordinary English.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.209
If we have the proposition O and
have that mean five is an odd number.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.919
And P,
meaning Paris is the capital of France.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.656
Then, under the ordinary model
of truth in the real world,

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:48.554
what could we say about
the sentence O implies P?

00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:54.290
That is, five is an odd number implies
Paris is the capital of France.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.070
Would that be true or false?

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.879
And let's look at one more example.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:03.179
If E is the proposition that
five is an even number, and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.100
M is the proposition that Moscow
is the capital of France,

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.180
what about E implies M?

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.752
Five is an even number implies
Moscow is the capital of France.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.300
Is that true or false?
