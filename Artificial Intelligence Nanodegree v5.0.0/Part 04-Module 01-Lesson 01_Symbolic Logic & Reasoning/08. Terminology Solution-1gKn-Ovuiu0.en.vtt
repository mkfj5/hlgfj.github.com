00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
P and not P is valid.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.500
That is, it's true when P is true because of this,

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.650
and it's true when P is false because of this clause.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.705
P and not P is unsatisfiable.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:16.125
The symbol can't be both true and false at the same time.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:22.045
P or Q, or P is equivalent to Q is valid.

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.760
So, we know that it's true when either P or Q is true.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.835
So that's three out of the four cases.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:29.155
In the fourth case,

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:30.625
both P and Q are false,

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.850
and that means, P is equivalent to Q.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.810
And therefore, in all four cases, it's true.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.500
P implies Q or Q implies P, that's also valid.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.630
Now, in ordinary English, that wouldn't be valid.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.450
If the two clauses or the two symbols,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.935
P and Q, were irrelevant to each other,

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:50.245
we wouldn't say that either one of those is true.

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:52.500
But in logic, one of the other must be

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.940
true according to the definitions of the truth tables.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.210
And finally, this one is more complicated.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.805
If food then party,

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:01.890
or if drinks then party,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.495
implies if food and drinks, then party.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.130
You can work it all out and both sides of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.970
the main implication work out to be equivalent to not food or not drinks or party.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.500
So that's the same as saying P implies P. Saying one side is equivalent the other side,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.700
and if they're equivalent, then the implication relation holds.
