00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.349
In this next section, Peter will
teach us about logic and planning.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.230
Peter, what important concepts
should our students look out for?

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.380
&gt;&gt; A logic is a way of
describing the world.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.970
When we make logical statements,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.900
we capture part of what we want to know
about the world, and ignore other parts.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.990
Any description is only partial.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.750
The beauty of logic is that once we've
made some statements about the world,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.329
we can then reason completely within
the logic without having to go back

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.250
to reference the world to
come to some conclusions.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.609
And it was guaranteed that to the extent
the original statements correctly

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.350
represent the world so too,
will that conclusions be correct.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.270
On the other hand, if you start
with something false then logic

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.040
will lead you to conclude
more false things.
