00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.270
Now let's talk about the syntax
of first order logic.

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:07.379
And like in propositional logic,
we have sentences,

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.560
which describe facts that are true or
false.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:17.239
But unlike propositional logic, we also
have terms, which describe objects.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:22.519
Now the atomic sentences are predicates
corresponding to relations.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.992
So we can say, Vowel (A) is an atomic

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:32.277
sentence or Above (A, B).

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:37.229
And we also have a distinguished
relation, the equality relation.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.705
We can say 2 = 2,

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:45.800
and equality relation is
always in every model.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:51.339
And sentences can be combined with all
the operators from propositional logic.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.800
So, that's and, or, not, implies,
equivalent, and parentheses.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:07.109
Now terms which refer to objects
can be constants, like A, B, and 2.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.933
It can be variables,
we normally use lowercase like x and y.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:17.912
And they can be functions, like number
of (A), which is just another name,

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:22.444
or another expression that
refers to the same object as 1,

00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:27.010
the least in the model
that we showed previously.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.219
And then there's one more type of
complex sentence, besides the sentences

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.280
we get by combining operators that
makes first order logic unique.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.150
And these are the quantifiers.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.042
And there are two quantifiers.

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:43.677
For all,

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:49.350
we write with an upside down A followed
by a variable that it introduces.

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:54.103
And there exists,
which we write with an upside down E,

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:57.855
followed by a variable
that it introduces.

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:02.518
So for example, we could say, for all x,

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:08.270
if x is a vowel,
then the number of x is equal to one.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.199
And that's a valid sentence
in first order logic.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.665
Or we could say, there exists an x

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:20.382
such that the number of (x) = 2.

00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:23.846
And this is saying that there's
some object in the domain to

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:27.450
which the number of function applies and
has a value of 2, but

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.759
we're not saying what that object is.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.848
Now another note is that sometimes as an
abbreviation, we'll omit the quantifier.

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:42.378
And when we do that, you can just
assume that it means for all,

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:45.119
that's left out just as a shortcut.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.052
And I should say that these forms
of these sentences are typical.

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:50.810
And you'll see these forms over and
over again.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.120
So typically, whenever we have a for

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.650
all quantifier introduced,
it tends to go with a conditional.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.277
Like vowel(x) implies number of (x) = 1.

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:04.689
And the reason is, because we usually
don't want to say something about

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.310
every object in the domain,
since the objects can be so different.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.849
But rather we want to say something
about a particular type of object.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.609
Say, in this case, vowels.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.970
And also, typically when we have
an exists an X or exists any variable,

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:28.756
that typically goes with just a form
like this and not with the conditional.

00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:32.569
Because we're talking about just one
object that we want to describe.
