00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.369
First answer is yes.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.830
This is a good representation of
the sentence, Sam has two jobs.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.550
It says there exists an x and y.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.929
One of them is a job of Sam.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.919
The other one is a job of Sam.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.100
And crucially,
we have to say that x is not equal to y.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.757
Otherwise, this will be satisfied and

00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:22.875
we can have the same job represented
by the variables x and y.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.166
Is this is a good representation
of the member function?

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.210
No, it does do a good job of
telling you what is a member.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.355
So, if x is a member of a set
because it's one member,

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:40.178
then we can always add other members,
and it's still a member of that set.

00:00:40.177 --> 00:00:43.570
But it doesn't tell you anything
about what x is not a member of.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.399
So, for example, we want to know that
3 is not a member of the empty set.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.414
But we can't prove that
with what we have here.

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:53.405
And we have a similar problem down here.

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:58.271
This is not a good representation
of the adjacent relation.

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:01.509
So it will tell you, for example,

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:07.105
that square(1,1) is
adjacent to square(2,1).

00:01:07.105 --> 00:01:10.893
And also to square(1,2), so
it's doing something, right?

00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:13.921
But one problem is that it doesn't
tell you any other direction.

00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:17.616
It doesn't tell you that
(2,1) is adjacent to (1,1).

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:22.383
And another problem is that it
doesn't tell you that (1,1) is not

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:27.734
adjacent to (8,9), because again there
is no way to prove the negative.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:33.329
And moral is that when you try to do
a definition like adjacent or member,

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.376
what you usually want to do is half
a sentence with the equivalent,

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:43.603
or bi-conditional sign to say,
this is true if and only if, rather

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:49.510
than to just have an assertion, or
to have an implication in one direction.
