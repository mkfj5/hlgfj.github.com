00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.779
Here's one more example of reasoning and
propositional logic.

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:05.449
In a particular model of the world,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.210
we know the following
three sentences are true.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.865
E, or B, implies A.

00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:18.115
A implies J and M.

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:20.658
And B.

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:24.877
You know these three sentences to
be true and that's all we know.

00:00:24.876 --> 00:00:30.945
Now, I want you to tell me, for
each of the five prepositional symbols,

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:35.435
is that symbol true or false or
unknown in this model?

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:40.488
And tell for the symbols E,

00:00:40.488 --> 00:00:43.354
B, A, J and M.

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:53.354
