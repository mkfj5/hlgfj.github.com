00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.546
We're going to talk
about first order logic,

00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:07.185
and its relation to the other
logics we've seen so

00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:11.619
far, namely propositional logic and
probability theory.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:16.775
And we're going to talk about them in
terms of what they say about the world,

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:21.182
which we called the ontological
commitment of these logics and

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:25.257
what types of beliefs agents
can have using these logics,

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:28.771
which we call
the epistemological commitments.

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:34.435
So in first order logic, we have
relations about things in the world,

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:38.539
objects, and functions on those objects.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.979
And what we can believe about those
relations is that they're true,

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.327
or false, or unknown.

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:50.640
So this is an extension of propositional
logic in which all we have

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.865
was facts about the world and we could
believe that those facts were true,

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:58.189
or false, or unknown.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.750
Now, in probability theory,
we have the same types of facts

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.444
as in propositional logic,
the symbols, or variables, but

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:12.129
the beliefs could be a real
number in the range zero to one.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:16.079
So logics vary both in what you
can say about the world and

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.399
what you can believe about what's
been said about the world.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.530
Another way to look at representation
is to break the world up

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.049
into representations that are atomic,
meaning that a representation

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.390
of the state is just an individual
state when no piece is inside of it.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.459
And that's what we used for
search and problem solving.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.569
We had a state like state A and

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.069
then we transition to another
state like state B, and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.579
all we can say about those states was,
are they identical to each other or not?

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.027
And maybe,
is one of them a goal state or not?

00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:56.909
But there wasn't any internal
structure to those states.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.183
Now in propositional logic as
well as in probability theory,

00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:05.760
we break up the world into a set
of facts that are true or false.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.969
So we call this a factored
representation, that is representation

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:16.050
that an individual state of the world
is factored into several variables,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.870
the B and E and A and
M and J, for example.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.060
And those could be Boolean variables or,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.120
in some types of representations,
not in propositional logic.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.020
They can be other types of
variables besides Boolean.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.130
Then the third type,

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.451
the most complex type of
representation we call structured.

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.039
And then the structured representation,

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:43.849
an individual state is not just
a set of values for variables,

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.319
but it can include relationships between
objects, a branching structure, and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.639
complex representations and relations
between one object and another.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.597
And that's what we see in
traditional programming languages.

00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:59.064
It's what we see in database.

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:01.079
They're called structured databases.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.240
And we have structured query
languages over those databases.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.870
And that's a most
powerful representation.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.210
And that's what we get
in first order logic.
