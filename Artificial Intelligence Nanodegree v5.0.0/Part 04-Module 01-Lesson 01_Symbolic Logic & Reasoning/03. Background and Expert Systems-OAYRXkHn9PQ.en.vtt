00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.429
Now in the early days of AI, there was
a lot of excitement and work on logic.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:08.279
Can you give us a bit of historical
perspective on the topic.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:13.000
&gt;&gt; AI started in the 50s through the 70s
with the idea that what we needed was

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.170
better languages and systems for
writing down logical statements, and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.170
once we have written enough of them,
we should be able to do anything.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.500
And some things worked great.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.789
We were able to make a program be
the best chess player in the world.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.039
But other projects failed.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.629
And I think there were two main issues.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:32.509
One, it was a mistake to try to make
statements only in Boolean logic,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.710
where everything is true or false.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.390
And that's because
the world is uncertain.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049
So the logic of probability
is a better fit to the world.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.788
And we didn't get good algorithms for

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.191
dealing with probability
until the mid 1980s.

00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:43.778
And two,

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:48.272
we realized it was too laborious to
try to write down everything by hand.

00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:50.911
In the 1990s to the current day,
more and

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.356
more data was becoming available online,
and now we think first of learning

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:58.913
about the world from data rather
than writing rules by hand.

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:01.187
And still logic has its place.

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:03.626
Well how is logic used today?

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.203
&gt;&gt; Well there's many domains
where we can eliminate much

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:10.939
of the uncertainty of the real world and
solve significant problems using logic.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.129
One example would be a company
like FedEx, planning

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:18.239
all the deliveries of its packages
using its huge fleet of vehicles.

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:20.549
We can describe this
as a logic problem and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.989
find a solution that minimizes time and
expense.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.160
&gt;&gt; Peter will also be talking about
algorithms that are useful for

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.719
understanding how expert systems work.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.980
Expert systems are used
throughout the world, and are so

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.510
common that most people don't even
think about them as AI anymore.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.980
One famous example is that during
the first Persian Gulf War,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.560
one superhuman decision made
by one military expert system

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.790
about where to place a supply base saved
the United States $2 billion, which

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.790
was more money than DARPA ever invested
in artificial intelligence research.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.088
One of the things I like about
this section is how you and

00:01:57.087 --> 00:02:01.464
Sebastian move from logical
representations to planning algorithms,

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:05.859
to planning algorithms for when actions
or even the world is uncertain.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:08.061
What directions do you
think we will be seeing for

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:09.745
planning algorithms in the future?

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:14.045
&gt;&gt; Well, learning from examples
would be an important area.

00:02:14.044 --> 00:02:17.949
Transfer of learning across domains,
where we learn to play in one area and

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.060
then execute that in another area.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
Interactive planning, where human
machine team solves problems together,

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.869
and a lot of the issues
are what's the best

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.569
interface rather than just
getting the right answer.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.509
Being able to work together as a team.

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:37.239
And being able to explain things in
terms that humans can understand, so

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.930
that the humans can add things that
might have been missed in the original

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.530
statement of the problem.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.020
&gt;&gt; In these videos, we are gonna look
out for the resolution algorithm.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.516
It is an elegant way of inferring new
knowledge from a knowledge base and

00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:50.414
is one of my favorite in this section.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:53.864
Graphplan, which is described
in the book reading,

00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:58.465
was created by Georgia Tech's own
Merrick Furst back in 1995, and

00:02:58.465 --> 00:03:02.313
made planning practical for
a whole new range of problems.

00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:07.608
Finally, value iteration is a key
concept for Markov decision processing.

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.335
Understanding these algorithms is a good
school for this section because they

00:03:11.335 --> 00:03:14.335
require a firm foundation in
the basics that are being taught.
