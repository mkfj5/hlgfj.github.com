00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.091
Now let's get some practice
in first order logic.

00:00:03.092 --> 00:00:06.249
I'm going to give you some sentences and
for each one,

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:08.869
I want you to tell me if it is valid.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.279
That is always true,
satisfiable but not valid.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:18.179
That is there's some models for
which it is true or

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.329
unsatisfiable, meaning there are no
models for which it is true.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.500
And the first sentence is,
there exist an x and

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.929
a y such that x equals y.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.271
Second sentence, there exist an x

00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:41.063
such that x equals x implies for

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:46.600
all y there exist A z such that y = z.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.480
Third sentence, for
all x, P(x) or not P(x).

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.623
And fourth, there exists an x P(x).
