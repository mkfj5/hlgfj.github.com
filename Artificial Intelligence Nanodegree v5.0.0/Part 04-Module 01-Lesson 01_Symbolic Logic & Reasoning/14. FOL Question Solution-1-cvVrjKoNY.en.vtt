00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.260
The answers are.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.629
The first sentence is valid.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.259
It's always true.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.310
Why is that?

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:11.179
Because every model has to have at least
one object and we can have both x and

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.320
y refer to that same object, and so
that object must be equal to itself.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.769
Second, the left hand side of
this implication has to be true,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.300
x is always equal to x.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.310
and the right hand side says for

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:27.599
every y does there exist
a z since that y equals z.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.030
And we can say yes, there is.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.329
We can always choose y itself for
the value of z and then y equals y.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.899
So true implies true,
that's always true.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.579
Now, third sentence for
all x P of x or not P of x, and

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.140
that's always true, because everything
has to be either in the relation for

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.759
P, or out of the relation for
P, so that's valid.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.719
And the fourth,
there exists in x P of x.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.989
That's true for the models in which
there is some x that is a member of P,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.609
but there doesn't necessarily
have to be any at all.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.629
P might be an empty relation.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:07.920
So this is satisfiable.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310
True in some models, but
not true in all models.
