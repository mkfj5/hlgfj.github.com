00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
Now, just one more thing.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.339
I can't help but

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:06.109
describe what is probably the most
famous probability problem at all.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.350
It's called the Monty Hall Problem,
after the game show host.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.039
The idea is that you're on a game
show and there's three doors.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.890
Door number 1, door number 2,
and door number 3.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.420
And behind each door is a prize.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.937
And you know that one of the doors
contains an expensive sports car,

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:26.702
which you would find desirable, and
the other two doors contain a goat,

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:29.200
which you would find less desirable.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.234
Now, you're given a choice, and
let's say you choose door number one.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.606
But according to the conventions
of the game, the host,

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:40.435
Monty Hall,
will now open one of the doors.

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:44.175
Knowing that the door that
he opens contains a goat.

00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:46.226
And he shows you door number three.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:50.066
And he now gives you the opportunity
to stick with your choice or

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.817
to switch to the other door.

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.405
What I want you to tell me is,

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:57.439
what is your probability of wining
if you stick to door number one?

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.000
And what is the probability of wining
if you switch to door number two?
