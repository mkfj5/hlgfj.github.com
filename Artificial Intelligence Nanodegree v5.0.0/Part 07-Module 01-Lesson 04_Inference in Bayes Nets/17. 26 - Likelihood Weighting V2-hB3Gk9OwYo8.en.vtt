00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.349
In likelihood weighting, we're going to
be collecting samples just like before.

00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:07.761
But we're going to add a probabilistic
weight to each sample.

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:11.710
Now, let's say we want to compute
the probability of rain given

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.702
that the sprinklers are on and
the grass is wet.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:19.149
We start as before,
we make a choice for cloudy.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:23.309
And let's say that, again,
we choose cloudy being positive.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.209
We want to make a choice for sprinkler.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.054
But we're constrained to always
choose sprinkler being positive, so

00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:34.112
we'll make that choice, and we know we
were dealing with cloudy being positive.

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:35.434
So, we're in this row and

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.692
we were forced to make this choice
of sprinkler being positive.

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:40.890
And that has a probability of only 0.1.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.807
So, we'll put that 0.1 into the weight.

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:45.410
Next, we'll look at the rain variable,
and

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.179
here we're not constrained in any way.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:53.929
So, we make a choice according to
the probability tables with cloudy being

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.630
positive and let's say that we
choose the more popular choice and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.184
rain gets the positive value.

00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:05.564
Now, we look at wet grass,
were constrained to choose positive and

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.314
we know that the parents
are also positive.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.334
So, we're dealing with this row here.

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:14.664
Since it's a constrained choice,
we're going to add in or multiply in

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:18.305
an additional weight and I want you to
tell me what that weight should be.
