00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is that the node for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.820
Mary calls in this network
is dependent on John calls.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.860
In the previous network,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.900
they were independent, given that we
knew that the alarm had occurred.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.710
But here, we don't know that
the alarm had occurred.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.920
And so, the nodes are dependent
because having information about one

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.000
will affect the information
about the other.
