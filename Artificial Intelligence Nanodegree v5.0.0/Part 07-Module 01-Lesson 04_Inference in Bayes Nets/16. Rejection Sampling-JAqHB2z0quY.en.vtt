00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.710
But there's a problem
with rejection sampling.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.400
If the evidence is unlikely, you end
up rejecting a lot of the samples.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.380
Let's go back to the alarm network
where we had variables for burglary and

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.520
for an alarm.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.832
And say we're interested in computing
the probability of a burglary given that

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:17.937
the alarm goes off.

00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.487
The problem is that burglaries
are very infrequent, so

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:24.733
most of the samples we would
get would end up being,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.529
we start with generating a B,
and we get a -B and then a -A.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.570
We go back and say, does this match?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.893
No?

00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:36.045
We have to reject the sample, so
we generate another sample, and

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:38.090
we get another minus -b, -a.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.298
We reject that, we get another -b,-a,
and we keep rejecting and eventually

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:48.219
we get a +b, but we'd end up spending
a lot of time rejecting samples.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.162
So we're going to introduce a new
method called Likelihood Weighting that

00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:54.820
generates samples so
that we can keep everyone.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.149
With likelihood weighting, we fix
the evidence variables, that is we say

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.864
that A will always be positive, and then
we sample the rest of the variables.

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:09.076
So then, we get samples that we want,
we would get

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:15.616
a list like -b, + a,- b, +a, +b, +a.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:18.507
We get to keep every sample,
but we have a problem.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:22.637
The resulting set of
samples is inconsistent.

00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:27.496
We can fix that however, by assigning
a probability to each sample and

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:28.537
weighing them correctly.
