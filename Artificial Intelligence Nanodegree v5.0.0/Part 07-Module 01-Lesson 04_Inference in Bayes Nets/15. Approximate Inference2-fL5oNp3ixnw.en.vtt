00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
Now the probability of sampling a particular variable choosing

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.250
a +W or a -W depends on the values of the parents.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.240
But those are chosen according to the conditional probability tables.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.160
So, in a limit, the count of each sampled variable will approach the true probability.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.764
That is, with an infinite number of samples,

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:23.490
this procedure computes the true joint probability distribution.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.440
We say that the sampling method is consistent.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.210
We can use this kind of sampling to compute

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.270
the complete joint probability distribution or we can

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.585
use it to compute a value for an individual variable.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.675
But what if we wanted to compute a conditional probability?

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:47.940
Say, we wanted to compute the probability of wet grass given that it's not cloudy.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.360
To do that, the sample that we generated here wouldn't be

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.215
helpful at all because it has to do with being cloudy,

00:00:55.215 --> 00:00:56.620
not with being not cloudy.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.675
So we would cross the sample off the list.

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:04.440
We would say that we reject the sample and this technique is called rejection sampling.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.640
We go through ignoring any samples that don't match

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.695
the conditional probabilities that we're interested in and keeping samples that do,

00:01:13.695 --> 00:01:20.150
say, the sample, -C, +S, +R, -W.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.505
Or we'd just continue going through generating samples,

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:25.620
crossing off the ones that don't match,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.165
keeping the ones that do.

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:29.685
And this procedure would also be consistent.

00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:33.580
We call this procedure rejection sampling.
