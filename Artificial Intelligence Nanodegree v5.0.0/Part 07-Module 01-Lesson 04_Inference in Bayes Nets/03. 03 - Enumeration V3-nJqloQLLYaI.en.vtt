00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.468
Now we're going to talk about how
to do inference on Bayes Net.

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:05.919
We'll start with our familiar network.

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.310
And we'll talk about
a method called enumeration.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.679
Which goes through all
the possibilities, adds them up.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.879
And comes up with an answer.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.429
So what we do is start
by stating the problem.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.789
We're going to ask the question of,
what is the probability that the burglar

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.559
alarm occurred giving that
John called and Mary called.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.299
We'll use the definition conditional
probability to answer this.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.091
So this query is equal to the joint
probability distribution of all three

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:37.716
variables divided by
the conditonalized variables.

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:40.219
Now note I'm using a notation here,

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.159
where instead of writing out probability
of some variable equals true.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:51.069
I'm just using the notation plus and
then the variable name in lowercase.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.230
And if I wanted the negation,
I would use negation sign.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.649
Notice there's a different notation

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.750
where instead of writing out
the plus and negation signs.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.932
We just use the variable name itself.

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:06.260
P(e) to indicate E is true.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.780
That notation works well but

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.430
it can get confusing between
does P(e) mean E is true.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.950
Or does it mean e is a variable?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.170
And so we're going to to stick to
the notation where we explicitly have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.239
the pluses and negation signs.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:26.024
To do inference by enumeration, you
first take a conditional probability and

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:28.858
rewrite it as unconditional
probabilities.

00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:32.472
Now we enumerate all
the atomic probabilities and

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:35.019
calculate the sum of products.

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.269
Let's look at just the complex
term on the numerator first.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.019
The procedure for

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:43.560
figuring out the denominator will
be similar and we'll skip that.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.430
The probability of these
three terms together

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.850
can be determined by enumerating all
possible values of the hidden variables.

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.888
In this case there are two, E and A,
so we'll sum over those variables for

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:58.504
all values of E and for all values of A.

00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:02.459
In this case they're Boolean, so
there's only two values of each.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.519
We ask what's the probability
of this unconditional term?

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:11.359
And that we get by summing out over all
possibilities, E and A being true or

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.190
false.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.629
Now, to get the values
of these atomic events,

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.984
we'll have to rewrite this equation
in a form that corresponds to

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:22.133
the conditional probability tables that
we have associated with the Bayes Net.

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.278
So we'll take this whole expression and
rewrite it.

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:30.460
It's still a sum over the hidden
variables E and A, but now we'll rewrite

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:35.740
this expression in terms of the parents
of each of the nodes in the network.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.080
So that gives us the product
of these five terms,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.100
which we then have to sum
over all values of e and a.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.119
If we call this product f(e,a),
then the whole answer

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.390
is the sum of f for
all values of e and a.

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.099
So it's a sum of four terms where
each of the terms is a product

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.479
of five numbers.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.780
Where do we get the numbers
to fill in this equation?

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.060
&gt;From the conditional probability
tables from our model.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.536
So let's put the equation back up and
we'll ask you for

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:15.038
the case where both e and
A, are positive,

00:03:15.038 --> 00:03:19.235
to look up in the conditional
probability tables.

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:22.828
And fill in the numbers, for
each of these five terms and

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:26.280
then multiply them together,
and fill in the product
