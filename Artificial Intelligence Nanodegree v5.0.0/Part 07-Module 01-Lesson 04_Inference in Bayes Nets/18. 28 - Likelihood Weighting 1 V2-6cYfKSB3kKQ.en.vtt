00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.692
When we include the weights, counting
this sample that was forced to have a +s

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:11.003
and a +w with a weight of 0.099, instead
of counting it as a full 1 sample,

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.810
we find that likelihood
weighting is also consistent.
