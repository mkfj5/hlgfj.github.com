00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.738
And the answer is,
that E is dependent on A.

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:04.879
That much is fairly obvious.

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:06.559
But it's also dependent on B.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:07.479
Now why is that?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.460
E is dependent on A,
because if the earthquake did occur,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.690
then it's more likely that
the alarm would go off.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.676
On the other hand,
E is also dependent on B.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:17.228
Because if a burglary occurred,

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:20.089
then that would explain why
the alarm is going off.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.359
And it would mean that
the earthquake is less likely.
