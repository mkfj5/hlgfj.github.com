00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.559
So we took our network with RT and L.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.969
We summed out over R.

00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:06.089
That gives us a new network with T and

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.679
L, with these conditional
probability tables.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.160
And now we want to do a join over T and
L, and

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.219
give us a new table with a joint
probability of P, of T, and L.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:18.902
And that table is
going to look like this.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:28.018
