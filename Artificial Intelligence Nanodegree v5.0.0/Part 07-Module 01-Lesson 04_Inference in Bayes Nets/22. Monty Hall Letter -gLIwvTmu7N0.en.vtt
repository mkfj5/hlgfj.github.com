00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.429
Now as a final epilogue,
I have here a copy of the letter written

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:09.580
by Monty Hall himself in 1990 to
Professor Lawrence Denenberg of Harvard,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.460
who with Harry Lewis
wrote a statistics book

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.570
in which they use the Monty Hall
problem as an example.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.399
And they wrote to Monty asking him for
permission to use his name.

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:24.509
Monty kindly granted the permission, but
in his letter he writes, as I see it,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.200
it wouldn't make any difference after
the player has selected Door A and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.280
having been shown Door C.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.840
Why should he then attempt
to switch to Door B?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.450
So we see Monty Hall himself did not
understand the Monty Hall problem.
