00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.948
We get the answer by reading numbers
off the conditional probability table.

00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:10.242
So the probability of B being positive
0.001, of E being positive because we're

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:15.429
dealing with the positive case now for
the variable E, is 0.002.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.283
Probability of A being positive
because we're dealing with that case,

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:20.869
given that B is positive.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.057
And the case when E is positive,
that we can read off here, is 0.95,

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:31.999
probability that J is positive
given that A is positive, is 0.9.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:36.081
To finally, probability that M is
positive given that A is positive,

00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:37.986
we read up here as 0.7.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:41.009
We multiply all those together,

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:46.193
it's going to be a small number
because we got the 0.001 and

00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:51.926
the 0.002 here,
that works out to 0.000001197.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:56.707
That seems like a really small number
but remember we have normalized by

00:00:56.707 --> 00:01:01.200
the P(J +MJ) and this is only
one of the four possibilities.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.569
We have to enumerate over all four
possibilities for E and A and

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:10.274
in the end, it works out that
the probability of the burglary alarm

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:14.320
being true given that John and
Mary calls Is 0.284.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.013
And we get that number because
intuitively it seems that the alarm is

00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:21.609
fairly reliable, John and
Mary calling are very reliable.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.390
But the prior probability
of burglary is low and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.269
those two terms combined together
to give us the 0.284 value when

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:32.839
we sum up each of the four
terms of these products.
