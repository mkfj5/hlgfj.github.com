00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.343
So that's how variable
elimination works.

00:00:02.343 --> 00:00:07.099
It's a continued process of joining
together factors to form a larger factor

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.390
and then eliminating
variables by summing out.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.734
If we make a good choice of the order
in which we apply these operations,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:16.304
then variable elimination can be much
more efficient in just doing the whole

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:17.051
enumeration.

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:21.018
