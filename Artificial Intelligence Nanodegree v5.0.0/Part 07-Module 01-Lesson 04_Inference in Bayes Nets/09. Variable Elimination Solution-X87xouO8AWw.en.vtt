00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.399
The answer is that for +t, we look up
the two possible values for r, and

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.413
we get 0.08 or 0.09.

00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:09.945
Sum those up, get 0.17.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:14.265
And then we look at the two
possible values of r for -t.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:18.054
And we get 0.02 and 0.81.

00:00:18.054 --> 00:00:21.516
Add those up, and we get 0.83.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:27.028
