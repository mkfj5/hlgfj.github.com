00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.419
The answer is that you have
a one third chance of winning,

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.209
if you stick with door number one.

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:07.779
And a two thirds chance if you
switch to door number two.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.910
How do we explain that?

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.609
Why and why isn't it 50 50?

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.989
While it's true that
there's two possibilities.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.740
But we have learned from probability,
that just because there are two options

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.019
doesn't mean that both
options are equally likely.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.089
It's easier to explain why the first
door has a one third probability,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.699
because when you started
the car could be in anyone or

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.989
three places, you choose one of them.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.529
That probability was one-third.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.170
And that probability hasn't been changed

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.190
by the revealing of one
of the other doors.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.007
Why is door number two two-thirds?

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:40.138
Well, one way to explain it is that
the probability has to sum to one, and

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:43.210
if one-third is here,
the two thirds has to be here.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.600
But why doesn't the same argument
that you use for one, hold for two?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.210
Why can't we say the probability of
two holding the car was a third,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.679
before this door was revealed?

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.253
Why has that changed two
that has not changed one?

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:02.659
And the reason is, because we've learned
something about door number two.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.429
We've learned that it wasn't the door
that was flipped over by the host.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.262
And so that additional information
has updated the probability.

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:13.590
Whereas we haven't learned anything
additional about door number one,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.409
because it was never an option that
the host might switch door number one.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.831
And in fact in this case
if we reveal the door,

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:24.085
we find that's where
the car actually is.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.498
So you see, learning probability,
may end up winning you something.
