00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.770
Likelihood weight is a great technique
but it doesn't solve all our problems.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.935
Suppose we want to compute
the probability of C given +s and +r.

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:12.800
In other words,
we're constraining sprinkler and

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.868
rain to always be positive.

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:18.980
Since we used the evidence when we
generate a node that has that evidence

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.734
as parents,

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:23.790
the wet grass node will always get
good values based on that evidence.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.378
But the cloudy node won't, and so

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:32.149
it will be generating values at random
without looking at these values.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.829
And most of the time or
some of the time,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.179
it'll be generating values that
don't go well with the evidence.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.530
Now we won't have to reject them
like we do in rejection sampling but

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.789
they'll have a low probability
associated with them.
