00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.439
Welcome back.

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.070
In the previous unit, we went over
the basics of probability theory and

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.300
saw how a Bayes network
could concisely represent

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.510
a joint probability distribution,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.759
including the representation of
independence between the variable.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.770
In this unit, we will see how
to do probabilistic inference.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.859
That is, how to answer probability
questions using Bayes Nets.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:25.969
Let's put up a simple Bayes net.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.283
We'll use the familiar
example of the earthquake,

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:33.969
where we can have a burglary or
an earthquake setting of the alarm.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.370
And if the alarm goes off,
either John or Mary might call.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.517
Now, what kinds of questions can
we ask to do inference about?

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:45.163
The simplest type of question is the
same question we ask with an ordinary

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:47.805
subroutine or
function in a programming language.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.126
Namely, given some inputs,
what are the outputs?

00:00:50.127 --> 00:00:53.108
So in this case, we could say,

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:57.939
given the inputs of B and
E, what are the outputs?

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.234
J and M, rather than call them input and
output variable,

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:08.120
in probabilistic inference, we'll call
them evidence and query variables.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.145
That is the variables that we know
the values of are the evidence.

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:16.510
And the ones that we want to find out
the values of, are the query variables.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.316
Anything that is neither evidence nor
query is known as a hidden variable.

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:25.150
That is,
we won't tell you what its value is,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.372
we won't figure out what
its value is and report it.

00:01:28.373 --> 00:01:31.058
But we'll have to compute
with it internally.

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:34.536
And now, furthermore,
in probabilistic inference,

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:38.609
the output is not a single number for
each of the query variables.

00:01:38.608 --> 00:01:41.111
But rather it's
a probability distribution.

00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:45.506
So the answer is going to be a complete
joint probability distribution over

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:46.838
the query variables.

00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:50.801
We call this the posterior distribution,
given the evidence.

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:52.814
And we can write it like this.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:55.500
It's the probability
distribution of one or

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.468
more query variables given the values
of the evidence variables.

00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:02.801
And there can be 0 or
more evidence variables, and

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:05.292
each of them are given an exact value.

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:08.413
And that's the computation
we want to come up with.

00:02:08.413 --> 00:02:12.243
There's another question we can ask,
which is the most likely explanation.

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:17.133
That is, out of all the possible
values for all the query variables,

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:21.364
which combination of values
has the highest probability.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:26.540
We write the formula like this
asking which Q values are maxable,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.806
given the evidence values.

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:32.055
Now, in an ordinary
programming language,

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.457
each function goes only one way.

00:02:34.457 --> 00:02:38.406
It has input variables,
does some computation, and

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:42.364
comes up with a result variable or
result variables.

00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:46.945
One great thing about base nets is that
we're not restricted to going only in

00:02:46.945 --> 00:02:47.959
one direction.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.228
We could go in the causal direction,

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:55.445
giving as evidence the root
nodes of the tree and

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:59.669
asking as query values
the nodes at the bottom.

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.650
Or we could reverse that causal flow.

00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:06.927
For example, we could have J and
M be the evidence variable and B and

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:12.028
E be the query variables or
we could have any other combination.

00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:16.569
For example, we could have
M be the evidence variable.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.754
And J and B be the query variables.

00:03:19.754 --> 00:03:21.329
Here's a question for you.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.773
Imagine the situation where Mary has
called to report that the alarm is

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:30.155
going off and we want to know whether or
not there has been a burglary.

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:35.367
For each of the nodes, click on
the circle to tell us if the node

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:39.894
is an evidence node,
a hidden node, or a query node.

00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:42.229
