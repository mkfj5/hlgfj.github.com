00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
The answer to the question is that we look at the parents.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.530
We find that the sprinkler variable is

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.080
negative so we're looking at this part of the table.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.390
And the rain variable is positive so we're looking at this part.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.770
So it would be these two rows that we would consider and, thus,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.370
we'd find there's a 0.9 probability for W,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.350
the grass being wet.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.715
And only 0.1 for it being negative.

00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:23.520
So the positive is more likely.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.675
And once we've done that,

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:28.585
then we generated a complete sample and we can write down the sample here.

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:34.740
We had +C, -S, +R and, assuming,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.990
we got a probability of a 0.9 and it came out in favor of the +W,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.340
that would be the end of the sample.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
Then, we could throw all this information out and start over again by

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.040
having another 50-50 choice for cloudy and then working our way through the network.
