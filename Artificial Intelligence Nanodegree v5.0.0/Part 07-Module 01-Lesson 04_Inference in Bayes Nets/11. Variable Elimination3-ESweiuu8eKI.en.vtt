Now we're down to a network
with a single node, T,L,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.599
with this joint probability table, and
the only operation we have left to do

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:10.699
is to sum out to give us
a node with just L in it.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:17.490
So the question is, to compute P of
L for both values of L, +l and -l.
