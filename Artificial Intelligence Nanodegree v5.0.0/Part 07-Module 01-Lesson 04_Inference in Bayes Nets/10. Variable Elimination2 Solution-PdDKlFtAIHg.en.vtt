00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.092
The answer, again, for

00:00:01.092 --> 00:00:04.057
adjoining variables is determined
by point wise multiplication.

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:09.692
So, you have 0.17 times 0.3 is 0.051,

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:15.333
+t and +l, 0.17 times 0.7 is 0.119.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:22.393
Then we go to the minuses,
minus 0.83 times 0.01 is 0.083.

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:27.990
And finally, 0.83 times 0.9 is 0.747.
