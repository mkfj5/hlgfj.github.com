00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.650
The answer is, we're looking for

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.619
the probability of having a positive w
given the positive s and a positive R.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.284
So that's in this row, so it's 0.99.

00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:16.545
So we take our old weight and
multiply it by 0.99,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:21.137
give us a final weight of 0.099 for

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:25.324
a sample of +c, +s, +r and +w.
