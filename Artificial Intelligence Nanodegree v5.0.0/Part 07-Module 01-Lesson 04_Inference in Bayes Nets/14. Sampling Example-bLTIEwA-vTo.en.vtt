00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Here's a new network that we'll use to

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.190
investigate how sampling can be used to do inference.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.905
In this network, we have four variables, they're all boolean.

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:12.330
Cloudy tells us if it's cloudy or not outside and that can have

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.095
an effect on whether the sprinklers are turned on and whether it's raining.

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:17.730
And those two variables, in turn,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.180
have an effect on whether the grass gets wet.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.384
Now, to do inference over this network using sampling,

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:27.750
we start off with a variable where all the parents are defined.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.825
In this case, there's only one such variable, cloudy.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:34.095
And its conditional probability table tells us that

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:38.260
the probability is 50 percent for cloudy and 50 percent for not cloudy.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.525
And so we sample from that,

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.190
we generate a random number and,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.760
let's say, it comes up with positive for cloudy.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.335
Now that variable is defined,

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:48.210
we can choose another variable.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.065
In this case, let's choose sprinkler.

00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:53.940
And we look at the rows in the table for which cloudy,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.760
the parent, is positive and we see,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.545
we should sample with probability 10 percent of +S and 90 percent of -S. And so,

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.500
let's say, we do that sampling with

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.250
a random number generator and it comes up negative for sprinkler.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.525
Now, let's jump over here,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.130
look at the rain variable.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.295
Again, the parent, cloudy, is positive.

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:17.305
So we're looking at this part of the table.

00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:20.130
We get a 0.8 probability for rain being positive

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.195
and a 0.2 probability for rain being negative.

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:27.820
Let's say, we sample that randomly and it comes up rain is positive.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.530
And now we're ready to sample the final variable.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.995
And what I want you to do,

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.980
is tell me which of the rows of

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.555
this table should we be considering and tell me what's more likely.

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:44.730
Is it more likely that we have a +W or a -W?
