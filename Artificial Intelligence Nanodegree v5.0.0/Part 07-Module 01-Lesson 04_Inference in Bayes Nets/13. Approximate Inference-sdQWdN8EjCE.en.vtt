00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.589
Now I want to talk about approximate
inference by means of sampling.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.650
What do I mean by that?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.138
Say we want to deal with a joint
probability distribution,

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:13.788
say the distribution of heads and
tails over these two coins.

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:17.829
We can build a table, and
then start counting by sampling.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.609
Here, we have our first sample,
we flip the coins, and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.250
the one cent piece came up heads, and
the five cent piece came up tails.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.600
So we would mark down one count,
then we'd toss them again.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.551
This time, the five cent is heads and
the one cent is tails, so

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:34.232
we put down a count there.

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:37.512
And we'd repeat that process,
and keep repeating it,

00:00:37.512 --> 00:00:41.700
until we got enough counts that we
could estimate the joint probability

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.094
distribution by looking at the counts.

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:48.185
Now, if we do a small number of samples,
the counts might not be very accurate.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:53.060
There may be some random variation that
causes them not to converge to the true

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.665
values.

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:55.750
But as we add more samples,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.719
the counts we get will come
closer to the true distribution.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.500
Thus, sampling has an advantage
over inference in that

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.780
we know a procedure for coming up with
at least an approximate value for

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.670
the joint probability distribution.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
As opposed to exact inference, where
the computation may be very complex.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.920
There's another advantage to sampling,
which is, if we don't know what

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.170
the conditional probability tables are,
as we did in our other models.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.596
If we don't know these numeric values,
but we can simulate the process,

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:29.418
we could still proceed with sampling,

00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:31.536
whereas we couldn't
with exact inference.

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:35.439
