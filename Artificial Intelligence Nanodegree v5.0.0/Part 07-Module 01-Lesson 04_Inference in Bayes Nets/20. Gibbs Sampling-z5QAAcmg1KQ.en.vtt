00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.700
A technique called Gibbs sampling,
named after the Physicist Josiah Gibbs,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.269
takes all the evidence into account,
not just the upstream evidence.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.849
It uses a method called
Markov Chain Monte Carlo, or MCMC.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.710
The idea is that we resample
just one variable at a time,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.179
conditioned on all the others.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.879
That is, we have a set of variables and
we initialize them to random variables,

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.489
keeping the evidence values fixed.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.359
Maybe we have values like this and
that constitutes one sample.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.004
And now, at each iteration through
the loop, we select just one

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.590
non-evidence variable and resample
it based on all the other variables.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.540
And that will give us another sample and
repeat that again.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.310
Choose another variable,
resample that variable and repeat.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.170
We end up walking around in this base
of assignments of variables randomly.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.350
Now, in rejection and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.429
likelihood sampling, each sample was
independent of the other samples.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.829
In MCMC, that's not true.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.289
The samples are dependent on each other,
and

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.120
in fact,
adjacent samples are very similar.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.240
They only vary or differ in one place.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:11.037
However, the technique
is still consistent.

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.530
You won't show the proof for that
