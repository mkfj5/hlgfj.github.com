00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.290
The answer is, that alarm is dependent
on both John and Mary, and so

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.470
we can draw both nodes in.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:10.589
Intuitively that makes sense,
because if John calls,

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.099
then it's more likely that the alarm has
occurred, likely as if Mary calls, and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.519
if both called it's really likely.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.850
So you can figure out the answer
by intuitive reasoning, or

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.750
you can figure it out by going to
the conditional probability tables and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.410
seeing, according to the definition
of conditional probability,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.510
whether the numbers work out.
