              "text": "## Continuing Your Journey\n\nYou've reached the end of the AIND program, but there is a **lot** more material in the subject of AI than we can fit into a few months. The reading list at the end of each module in the AIND include links to external resources that you can read to learn more about each topic. You should also consider completing a free course or Nanodegree program on machine learning or deep learning to learn more new tools, and explore modern directions of AI applications. \n\nDeep learning in particular has been dominating headlines for several years with state of the art performance across a wide range of tasks like object recognition, natural language tasks, cancer detection, and more. It’s natural to wonder if “classical” AI is still relevant. But that supposes a false dichotomy—deep learning (or machine learning in general) is not strictly an alternative to other forms of AI. Your goal in developing future AI systems will be to use the best available tools for a given task—deep learning or otherwise.\n\n## Case Studies\nConsider the problems below and the examples presented of commercial solutions. Calling back to the introduction, would you consider these AI?  \n\n### How would you solve planning, routing, and scheduling at scale?\nUPS developed [ORION](https://pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=Factsheets&id=1426321616277-282)–a proprietary algorithm for planning driver routees–which they say eliminates 100 million miles of driving each year and saving the company 10 million gallons of gasoline, which adds up to nearly $50 million annually. \n\n### How would you represent human knowledge so that a computer could reason?\nIBM famously defeated human Jeopardy champions in 2011. According to [The AI behind Watson](https://www.aaai.org/Magazine/Watson/watson.php), Watson was powered by DeepQA which made use of more than 100 NLP algorithms, and launched [DeepQA - Towards the Open Advancement of Question Answering Systems](http://domino.watson.ibm.com/library/CyberDig.nsf/papers/D12791EAA13BB952852575A1004A055C/$File/rc24789.pdf)\n\n### How would you compete with human experts in more complex domains?\nIn 2017, [Libratus](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0772.pdf) became one of the first systems to beat human expert players in heads up poker (which is a very challenging domain for AI because it has a huge search space, and imperfect information). Can you think of any other domains where machines might want to reason with imperfect information?\n\n## Other courses\nIf you're interested in taking additional AI courses, we have a few suggestions:\n- [Knowledge-Based AI](https://www.udacity.com/course/knowledge-based-ai-cognitive-systems--ud409) addresses so-called expert systems and knowledge representations (which would be useful for building a system like Watson for Jeopardy!)\n- The [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) introduces key techniques powering many of the most exciting recent advances in AI. You'll learn about various network architectures and applications, with an emphasis on real-world applications.\n- If you haven't already taken the [Machine Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t), then this program can teach you a variety of techniques for modeling real-world data that can be used as standalone products or as part of an end-to-end AI system.\n- Take the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) to learn how to train your own AI agents to perform a variety of complex tasks.\n\n# Congratulations on completing the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree program!",
