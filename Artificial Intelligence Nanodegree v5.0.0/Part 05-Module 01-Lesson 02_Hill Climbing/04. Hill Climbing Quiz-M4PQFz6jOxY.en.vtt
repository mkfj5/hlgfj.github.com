00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.560
We are going to consider
multiple starting points for

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.964
the hill climbing
algorithm in this quiz.

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.750
By convention,
we'll call these particles.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.890
For each of these particles, tell us
their value assuming your algorithm

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.600
has a step size of one and that it stops
when no positive gradient is found.
