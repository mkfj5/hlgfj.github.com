00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.710
While we´re on this topic, I'd like
to talk about local beam search.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.950
Because we'll use it
later in the course.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.199
&gt;&gt; Okay, it's your show after all.

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.189
&gt;&gt; The local beam search,
instead of just using one position,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.219
which I'll call particle,
just because that's how I think of it.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.510
We'll keep track of K-particles.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.377
At each time frame,

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.705
we'll look at the randomly generated
neighbors of each of these particles.

00:00:20.705 --> 00:00:23.759
And keep the k-best ones for
the next iteration.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.230
If ever any of these particles have
reached your goal, we terminate.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.949
Now you'd think that this algorithm 
is just like random restart.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.829
&gt;&gt; But it's not, because we are
comparing all the neighbors of all of

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.059
the particles to each other.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.910
There is information being
passed to each position, right?

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.709
Normal random restart doesn't share any
of this information between iterations.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.719
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:42.820
&gt;&gt; Okay, that seems fine.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.689
But I've heard you talk about stochastic
beam search before as being more useful.

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:48.000
How is that different?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.140
&gt;&gt; Stochastic beam search
is the same thing.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.920
But the successors are chosen not just
based on their fitness, but with some

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.539
randomness, which helps ensure that we
don't get stuck in a local maximum.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.500
This idea has some similarity
to simulated kneeling.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.159
As in the class of algorithms to
which genetic algorithms belongs,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.547
which we'll tackle next.
