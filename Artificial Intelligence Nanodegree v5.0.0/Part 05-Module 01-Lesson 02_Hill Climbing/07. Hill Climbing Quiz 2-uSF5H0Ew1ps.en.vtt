00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.489
Particle 1 starts at seven and
with a step size of two,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.830
it reaches the peak of 10,
with one step.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.189
Particle 2 starts at eight,
it goes towards the peak, but

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.830
then it oscillates around the peak
because the step size is too large.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.920
Particle 3 starts at 10,
follows this upward gradient, but

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.200
then it gets stuck at this plateau
