00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.246
Particle 1 starts at x=1 and
follows a positive gradient up, but

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:07.100
then it gets stuck at
the shoulder where y=2.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.402
Particle 2 starts at x=8 and
follows a positive gradient up, but

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:14.281
it gets stuck at this
local maximum at y=6.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.197
Particle 3 starts at x=9 and follows
the positive gradient in the right

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:21.747
direction, but again it gets
stuck at a local maximum, at y=8.

00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:26.200
Particle 4 starts at x=14 and
also goes to the same local maximum.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.400
Particle 5 starts at x=20 and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.339
follows the positive gradient up
towards the global maximum at y=12.
