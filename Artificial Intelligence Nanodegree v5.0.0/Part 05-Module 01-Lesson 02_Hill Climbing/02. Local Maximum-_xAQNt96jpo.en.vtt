00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.830
Suppose I start here.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.969
I look to the left and it goes down.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.850
I look to the right and it's going up.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.090
So I'll take a step in that direction.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.620
&gt;&gt; And
what do you do when you reach the top?

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.770
&gt;&gt; Well we will get stuck, just like
we did with the end queens problem.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.220
There's no immediate step that I can
do that has a positive gradient.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.680
Everything is negative, that's a bummer.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.450
&gt;&gt; Is that a problem,
didn't we want to get to a maximum?

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.280
&gt;&gt; We actually wanted to
get to the global maximum.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.490
Looking at the graph,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.490
we can see that there's actually
a taller peak over here.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.860
&gt;&gt; I see, but
our computer agent doesn't know that.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.610
It can only see what's one
step away from it, right?

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.560
So how are you going to get unstuck?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.780
&gt;&gt; But what if I just start
again somewhere else?
