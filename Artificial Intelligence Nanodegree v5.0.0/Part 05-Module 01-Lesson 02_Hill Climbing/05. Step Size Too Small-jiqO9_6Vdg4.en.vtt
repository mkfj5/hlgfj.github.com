00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.960
Does hill climbing have any other
problems we should worry about?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.570
&gt;&gt; Suppose we start at the left edge
of the graph, using small steps

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.040
we gradually climb higher until
we get to the shoulder here.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.240
However, if we stop when we no
longer see a way to improve we

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.890
can get stuck at this shoulder.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt; So you mean we get to this point and
if the step size is small enough

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.360
we never see the sudden
increase in gradient here?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.880
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.560
For flat areas how do we
know which way to travel?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.860
If we just choose a direction randomly
we can wander on this plateau for

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.760
a while.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.220
The code needs to return
a result at some point.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.900
So how many times in a row should we
allow a zero improvement in score before

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.910
we stop?

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.908
We could just keep going in the
direction of the last positive gradient.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.900
But with a small enough step size,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.110
we can easily think we are not improving
and the algorithm should stop.
