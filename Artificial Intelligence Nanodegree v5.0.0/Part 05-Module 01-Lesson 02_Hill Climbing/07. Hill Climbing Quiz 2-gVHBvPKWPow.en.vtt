00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.967
Now assume your algorithm
has a step size of 2.

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:05.783
It still stops when no
positive gradient is found.

00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:07.980
What value would these particles return?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.465
Particle 1 starts at x equal to 7.

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:15.767
Particle 2 starts at x equal to 8, and
particle 3 starts at x equal to 10.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:19.090
Select their appropriate answer for each
particle from the choices given here.
