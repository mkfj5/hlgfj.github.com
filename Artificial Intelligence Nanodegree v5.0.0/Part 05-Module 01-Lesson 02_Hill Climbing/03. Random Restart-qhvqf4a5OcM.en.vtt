00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.930
This time I start here and

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.870
I go to to the left because
that is the positive gradient.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.440
And I'm going to get to
the top of the global maximum.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.080
&gt;&gt; But what's the chance that you're
going to get to global maximum on your

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.165
second attempt?

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.360
&gt;&gt; Better than just with my first
attempt, but I see what you mean.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
We're computer scientists and
we have computer power to burn.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.560
We can just do lots of random restarts,
hill climb

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.500
until we reach the local peak, and then
take the maximum of all the iterations.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.680
&gt;&gt; How do you know you've
done enough examples?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.270
&gt;&gt; Well, let's just do lots.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.390
It's inefficient, but as our number of
samples goes to infinity it should work.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.120
&gt;&gt; Well, you could be more efficient and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.930
keep track of the places on
the graph you've been before, and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.530
restart the sample whenever you see
you've gotten to the same place.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.430
That trick is called a taboo search,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.630
as in it's taboo to go
somewhere you've already been.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.810
&gt;&gt; Well I could also just keep
a list of all the local maxima and

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.040
try to get an idea of the general
shape of the problem, and try

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.630
to predict where a new maximum might be,
given the areas I haven't explored yet.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.400
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a variant
of the stage algorithm.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.890
&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is that random
restart seems like a good idea in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.210
general, given that there are all these
improvements that have been made.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.560
&gt;&gt; Yup, let's try a quiz on
what we've learned so far.
