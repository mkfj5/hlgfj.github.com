00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.140
Well then why not just
keep the step size large?

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.490
&gt;&gt; A couple of reasons.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.640
First, with a really large step size,
we can miss sharp hills completely.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.269
Going back to our first starting place.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.969
If my step size is this big, I would
skip the hill I intended to take.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.810
And would start going up
the next hill instead.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.919
&gt;&gt; Well, that seems obvious, but
you said there were a couple of reasons.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.650
What's the other one?

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.519
&gt;&gt; In certain situations, the algorithm
could get into a infinite loop and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.850
never terminate.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.740
For example,
look at the hill with a global maximum.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.280
If I start to the left of it,
above the shoulder.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.980
And have a step size this big,
I'll skip to the other side of the hill.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.559
Now the gradient is going
to go back the other way.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.039
So, I step back in
the direction in which I came.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.880
End up close to where I started.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.190
The algorithm can oscillate and
not converge on the answer.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:49.829
&gt;&gt; But it should be easy to check for
that in our code.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939
Maybe if we see oscillation,
we could just do smaller steps.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:54.710
&gt;&gt; You've hit upon a key idea.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.969
We can start with a large step size and
decrease it over time.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.609
To better ensure,
that we reach the global maximum.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.189
However, we'll get the same result with
something called simulated annealing.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.659
Which is one of the big
concepts of this course.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.469
&gt;&gt; Before we continue,

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.939
I'd like to experiment a bit
with these hill climbing ideas
