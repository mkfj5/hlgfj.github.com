00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.169
Hi and welcome to the first
lesson of the Udacity

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.890
artificial intelligence
nanodegree program.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:10.370
My name is Luis Serrano and I'm one
of the instructors here at Udacity.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.209
Before being here I used to work
in machine learning in Google.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.219
I'm the team that generated your
YouTube video recommendations.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.211
In this lesson we'll learn two
very important concepts of

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.539
artificail intelligence,
constraint propagation and search.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.679
We'll do this in a very fun setting
without going into too much detail

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.449
as we'll be studying these
concepts later in the course.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.780
The setting is creating an AI agent
that will solve any Sudoku puzzle.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.130
As you may know, a Sudoku puzzle
consists of a nine by nine grid

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.590
filled with the numbers
from one to nine.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.005
The only rule that applies is,
in each row, column and three by three

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.130
sub-square, all the numbers from one
to nine should appear exactly once.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.060
For example, here's a Sudoku puzzle and
here's its solution.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.509
The goal of this lesson is to build and
code an AI agent that solves any Sudoku.

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:04.319
The algorithm fully used are based from
the great blog post of Peter Norvig,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.540
one of these nanodegrees instructors.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390
You can find the link in
the instructor comments below.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.829
At some points throughout this lesson,
I'll be doing the work.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.769
And others, you'll be jumping
in to answer quiz questions and

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.489
to actually call some of
these functions in Python.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:21.799
After the lesson, you'll complete
a project that allows you to more fully

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.250
develop and code a number of
extensions to the algorithm.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.450
When you submit the project you'll get
a code review with feedback from one of

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.579
our talented reviewers.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.239
Here is what the final
output will look like.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.769
Pretty cool, right?

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:35.899
So, what do you say?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.420
