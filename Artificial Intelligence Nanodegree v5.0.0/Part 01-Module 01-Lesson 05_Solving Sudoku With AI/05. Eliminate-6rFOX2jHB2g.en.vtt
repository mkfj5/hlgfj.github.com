00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.556
Okay, here's our first technique.

00:00:01.556 --> 00:00:04.109
It's called Eliminate,
and it works as follows.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.550
Let's start with a simple board, and
let's say we have one box filled in.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.170
For example,
this box is filled in with a seven.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.849
So what do we know?

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.849
Well, we know that every row, column,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.478
or three-by-three square must
contain exactly one seven.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.730
So in particular, any box in
the same row can't contain a 7,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.899
any box in the same column
also can't contain a 7.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.901
And finally, any box in the same
3x3 square can't contain a 7.

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:35.049
So we've gathered some information on
the board just by looking at one box.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.811
So let's see how to apply this in real
life, let's look at this Sudoku and

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:40.109
this highlighted box here.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.729
And let's look at all the possibilities
for the values of this box.

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.109
We'll highlight in blue the boxes
in the same units as it.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.460
First, we can see that the value
of this box cannot be a 1,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.990
since there's a 1 in the same 3x3 box.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.279
Same thing with 2,
since there's a 2 in the same column.

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:03.117
We continue this process for

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:08.566
3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:12.540
And we conclude that the only
available value for this box is 4.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.410
Thus we assign the value 4 to this box.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.310
This is called
the elimination technique.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.549
You'll have the chance to code it below.
