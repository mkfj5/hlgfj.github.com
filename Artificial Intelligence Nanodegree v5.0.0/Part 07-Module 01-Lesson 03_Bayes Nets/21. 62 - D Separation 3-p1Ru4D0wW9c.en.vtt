00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.405
This leads me to the general study of Conditional independence

00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:12.370
in Bayes Networks that works often called D-Separation or Reachability.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.858
D-Separation is best studied by so called Active Triplet's and Inactive Triplet's.

00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:20.725
We have Active Triplet's render

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:25.415
variables dependent and Inactive Triplet's render them independent.

00:00:25.415 --> 00:00:32.547
Any chain of three variables like this makes the initial and final variable dependent,

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:34.300
if all variables are known.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.955
However, if the central variable is known that it's behind the conditioning bar,

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:43.740
then this variable and this variable become independent.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.295
So, if you have a structure like this and

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:50.605
it's "cut off" by a known variable in the middle,

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:53.089
that separates or d

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.245
separates the left variable from the right variable and it will become independent.

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.425
Similarly, any structure like this

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:04.025
renders the left variable and the right variable dependent,

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:07.621
unless, the center variable is known,

00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:11.165
in which case the left and right variable become independent.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.440
Another Active Triplet's now requires knowledge

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.823
of a variable.This is the explain away case.

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:23.830
If this variable is known for any reason it will be converted into a single variable,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.259
then this variable and this variable here become dependent.

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.020
Contrast this to the case that all variable is now unknown.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.560
A situation like this means that this variable

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.455
on the left and on the right are actually independent.

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:41.347
In a single final example,

00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:45.010
we also get dependence if we have

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.285
the following situation and direct successor of a conversion variable is known.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:55.565
So it is sufficient if a successor of these variables is known,

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:58.090
the variable itself does not have to be known.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.370
And the reason is if you know this guy over

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.910
here we need to get knowledge of this guy over here and,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.345
by virtue of that, the case over here essentially applies.

00:02:07.345 --> 00:02:09.163
iF YOU look at those rules,

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:13.540
Those rules allow you to determine for any Bayes Network

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.725
whether variables are dependent or not dependent given the evidence you have.

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:23.245
If you color the notes dark for which you do have evidence,

00:02:23.245 --> 00:02:26.370
then you can use these rules to understand whether

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.470
any two variables are condition dependent or not.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.186
So let me ask you for

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:37.965
this relatively complicated Bayes Network the following questions: is F independent of A,

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:39.691
is F independent of A given D, is F independent of A given G and is F independent

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:46.835
of A given H?

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.430
Please mark your answer as you see fit.
