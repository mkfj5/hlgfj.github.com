00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.080
Now the answer follows the exact
same scheme as before,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.800
with S being replaced by not S.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.910
So this should be an easier question for
you to answer, P of R given H,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.829
and not S, can be inverted by
Bayes rule to be as follows.

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.289
Once we apply Bayes rule,
as indicated over here,

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.699
where we sort H to the left side and
R to the right side,

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.669
you can observe that this value over
here can be readily found in the table.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.320
It's actually the 0.9 over there.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.631
This value over here,
the raise is independent of the weather

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.380
Bayes network, so it's just 0.01.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.870
And as before, we apply total
probability, the expression over here.

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.728
And we obtain of this
course over here,

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:52.597
that these two expressions are the same.

00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:54.679
P of H given not S not R.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.012
R is the value over here.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.484
And the 0.99 is the compliment
of probability of R,

00:01:00.484 --> 00:01:06.143
taken from over here and
that ends up to be 0.0833.

00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:08.784
This will be the right answer.
