00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.629
We have tried the same trick as before,
where we use exact same prior

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.657
of first plus gives
the following factors, 0.9, 0.2.

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:14.557
But our minus gives us
the probability 0.1 for

00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:18.178
a negative test result
treatment of cancer.

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:25.169
And a 0.8 for the inverse of a negative
result of not getting cancer.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.760
You multiply those together,
you get a normalized probability.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.573
And if you now normalize by
the sum of those two things to

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:36.920
turn the statement to a probability,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.578
you get 0.0009 over the sum of
those two things over here.

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:47.498
And this is 0.0056 for the chance

00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:52.567
of having cancer, and 0.9943 for

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:57.649
the chance of being cancer-free.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.719
And this adds up approximately to 1,

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.619
and therefore it's
a probability distribution.
