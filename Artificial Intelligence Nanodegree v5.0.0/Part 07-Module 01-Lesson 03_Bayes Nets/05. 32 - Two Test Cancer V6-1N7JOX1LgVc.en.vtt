00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.459
The reason why I gave you all this
is because I wanted to apply it now

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.530
to a slightly more complicated problem,
which is the two test cancer example.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:14.309
In this example, we, again,
might have our unobservable cancer c,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.539
but now we're running two tests,
test one and test two.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.073
As before,
the prior probability of cancer is 0.01.

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:29.893
The probability of receiving a positive
test result for either test is 0.9.

00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:36.387
Probability of getting a negative
result, keeping them cancer free is 0.8.

00:00:36.387 --> 00:00:40.862
And from those we were able to
compute all the other properties.

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:42.787
I'm just going to write
them down over here.

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.424
So take a moment to just write my notes.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:49.406
Now let's assume both of my
tests come back positive.

00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:55.262
So T1 = +, and T2 = +.

00:00:55.262 --> 00:01:02.629
What's the probability of cancer now,
written in short form P(C|++)?

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.079
I want you to tell me what that is.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.620
And this is a non trivial question.
