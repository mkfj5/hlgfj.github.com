00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.560
And the answer to this one
is really interesting.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.571
A is clearly not independent of
E because through C we can see

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.105
an influence of A to E.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:10.690
Given B that doesn't change.

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:14.709
A still influences C
despite the fact we know B.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.260
However if we know C,
the influence is cut off.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.500
There is no way A can
influence E if we know C.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.544
A is clearly independent of B.

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:27.829
They're different entry variables,
they have no incoming arcs.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.750
&gt;&gt; But here is the caveat,
given C, A and B become dependent.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.030
&gt;&gt; So whereas initially A and
B were independent,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.579
if you give C they become dependent.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.039
And the reason why they become
dependent we've studied before is

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.339
the Explain away effect.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.170
If we know for example C to be true,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.550
then knowledge of A will substantially
affect what we believe about B.

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.869
If there is two joint causes for C and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.549
we happen to know A is true,
we will discredit cause B.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.323
If we happen to know A is false we'll
increase our belief for the cause B.

00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:09.365
There was an effect we studied
extensively in the happiness example I

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:10.780
gave you before.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.710
The interesting thing here is you're
facing a situation where knowledge of

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:21.780
a variable C renders previously
independent variables dependent.
