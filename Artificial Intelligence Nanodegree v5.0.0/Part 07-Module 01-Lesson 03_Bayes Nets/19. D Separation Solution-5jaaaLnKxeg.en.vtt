00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.718
So C is not independent of A.

00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:09.063
In fact, A influences C by virtue of B.

00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:13.388
But if you know B,
then A becomes independent of C,

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:17.021
which means the only
determinant to C is B.

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:17.918
If you know B for

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.856
sure, then knowledge of A won't
really tell you anything about C.

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:27.605
C is also not independent of D, just
the same way C is not independent of A.

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:31.410
If I learn something about D,
I can infer more about C.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.980
But if I do know A, then it's hard to
imagine how knowledge of D would help

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:42.029
me with C because I can't learn anything
more about A than knowing A already.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.950
Therefore, given A,
C and D are independent.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.470
The same is true for E and C.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.670
If you know D then E and
C become independent.
