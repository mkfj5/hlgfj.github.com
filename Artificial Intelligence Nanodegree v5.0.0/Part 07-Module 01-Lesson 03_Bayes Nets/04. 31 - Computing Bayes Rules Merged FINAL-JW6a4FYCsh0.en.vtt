00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.220
So we just encountered our
very first Bayes network and

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:06.669
did a number of
interesting calculations.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:11.199
Let's now talk about Bayes Rule and
look into more complex Bayes networks.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.139
I want to look at Bayes Rule again and

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.820
make an observation that
is being non-trivial.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.120
Here is Bayes Rule, and
in practice what we find is

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.620
this term here is relatively easy
to compute, it's just a product.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.530
Whereas this term is
really hard to compute.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.890
However, this term over here does not
depend on what we assume for variable A.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.500
It's just a function of B.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.359
So suppose for

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.100
a moment we also care about the
complementary range of not A given B.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800
For which Bayes will unfold as follows.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.640
Then we find that the normalizer
P of B is identical

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.219
whether we assume A on the left side or
not A on the left side.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:59.289
We also know that P of A given B
plus P of not A given B must be one.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.579
Because these are two
complimentary events.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.719
It allows us to compute Bayes
rule very differently by

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.010
basically ignoring the normalizer.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.890
So here's how it goes.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.927
You compute P of A given B and

00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:17.260
you're going to call this prime
because it's not a real probability.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.179
It will be just P of B
given A times P of A,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.600
which is the normalizer to the
denominator of the expression over here.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.769
We do the same thing not A.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:33.626
So in both cases,
we compute the posterior probability not

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.390
normalized while omitting
the normalizer B.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.569
And then we can recover
the original probabilities

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.539
by normalizing based on
those values over here.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.470
So the probability of A given B,
the actual probability,

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.519
is a normalizer eta times this
not normalized form over here.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:57.033
The same is true for
the negation of A, over here.

00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:02.783
And eta is just the normalizer
results by adding these two values

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:09.189
over here together as shown over
here and dividing them by one.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:10.859
So take a look at this for a moment.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.710
What we've done is we deferred the
calculation of the normalizer over here.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.920
By computing pseudo probabilities
that are non-nominalized.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:21.549
This made the calculation much easier.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.353
And returned everything we just
folded back in the normalizer based

00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:31.164
on the resulting pseudo probabilities
and get the correct answer.

00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:40.188
