00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.418
Now, to understand the explain away
effect, you have to compare this to

00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:09.266
the probability of a raise
given that we're just happy and

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.188
we don't know anything
about the weather.

00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:14.076
So let's do that exercise next.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:18.914
So my next quiz is what's
the probability of a raise given that

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.952
all I know is that I'm happy and
I don't know about the weather?

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:28.282
Now this happens to be, once again,
a pretty complicated question.

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:28.980
So take your time.
