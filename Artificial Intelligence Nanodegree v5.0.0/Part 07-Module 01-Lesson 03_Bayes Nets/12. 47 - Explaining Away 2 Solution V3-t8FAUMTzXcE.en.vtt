00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.700
So this is a difficult question.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
Let me compute an auxiliary variable,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.580
which is P of Happiness, that one is

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.599
expanded by looking at the different
conditions that can make us happy.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.314
P of Happiness given S and
R, times P of S and

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:23.443
R, which is of course
the product of those two,

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:27.175
because independent plus P of Happiness.

00:00:27.175 --> 00:00:32.935
Given not S R, probability of
not S R + P of H given S and

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:37.031
not R times the probability
of P of S and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.289
not R plus the last case P
of H given not S and not R.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.438
So this just looks at the happiness and

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:48.630
all four combinations of the variables
that could lead to happiness.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.660
And you can plug those straight in,
this one over here is 1.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.606
And this one over here
is the product of S and

00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:00.598
R which is 0.7 times 0.01.

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:06.078
And as you plug all of those in,
you get as a result,

00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:09.796
0.5245, that's P(H).

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:14.582
Just take some time and do the math by
going through these different cases

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:17.494
using probability and
you get this result.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:24.636
Now armed with this number,
the rest now becomes easy which is,

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:29.131
we can use Bayes rule
to turn this around,

00:01:29.132 --> 00:01:33.114
P(H given R) P(R) over P(H).

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:37.719
P(R) we know from over here,
the probability of a raise is 0.01.

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:41.302
So the only thing we need to
compute now is P(H given R).

00:01:41.302 --> 00:01:45.548
And again we applied sort of probability
let me just do this over here.

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:49.912
We can factor P(H given
R) as P(H given R,S) for

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:54.684
sunny times probability of
sunny plus P(H given R) and

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:58.656
not sunny times
the probability of not sunny.

00:01:58.656 --> 00:02:03.882
And if you plug in the numbers for
this you get 1

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:11.254
times 0.7 + 0.9 times 0.3
that happens to be 0.97.

00:02:11.254 --> 00:02:18.700
So if you now plug this all back
into this equation over here,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.832
we get 0.97 times 0.01 / 0.5245.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:31.993
This gives us approximately,
as a correct answer, 0.0185.
