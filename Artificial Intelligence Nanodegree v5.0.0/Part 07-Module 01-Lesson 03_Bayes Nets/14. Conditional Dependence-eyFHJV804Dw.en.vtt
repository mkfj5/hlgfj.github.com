00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.262
It's really interesting to compare
this to the situation over here.

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:07.387
In both cases, I'm happy,
as shown over here.

00:00:07.386 --> 00:00:12.051
And I asked the same question,
which is whether I got a raise at work,

00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:13.269
this R over here.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.637
But in one case,
I observe that the weather is sunny and

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:18.230
in the other one isn't.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.557
And look what it does to my probability
of having received a raise.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:26.054
The sunniness perfectly
well explains my happiness.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:31.126
And my probability of
having received a raise

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:36.339
ends up to be a mere 1.4%, or 0.014.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.874
However, if my wife observes it to
be not sunny, then it is much more

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:45.344
likely that the cause of my happiness
is related to a raise at work.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.987
And now the probability is 8.3%,

00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:52.042
which is significantly
higher than the 1.4% before.

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:56.268
Now, this is a Bayes'
network of which S and

00:00:56.268 --> 00:01:01.993
R are independent, but
H adds a dependence between S and R.

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:06.519
Let me talk about this in a little
bit more detail on the next paper.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:06.979
So here's a
