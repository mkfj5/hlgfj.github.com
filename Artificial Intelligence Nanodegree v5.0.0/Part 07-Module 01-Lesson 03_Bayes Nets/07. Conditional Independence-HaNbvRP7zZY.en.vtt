00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.241
And the correct answer is no.

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.899
Intuitively, getting a positive
test result of what cancer

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.478
gives us information about
whether you have cancer or not.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.779
So if you get a positive test result,

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.277
you're going to raise
the probability of having cancer.

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:19.810
So relative to the prior probability.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.693
With that increased probability,

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:28.169
we will predict that another test will,
with a higher likelihood,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.951
give us a positive response than if
we hadn't taken the previous test.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.401
It's really important to understand.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:41.410
So that we understand it, let me make
you calculate those probabilities.
