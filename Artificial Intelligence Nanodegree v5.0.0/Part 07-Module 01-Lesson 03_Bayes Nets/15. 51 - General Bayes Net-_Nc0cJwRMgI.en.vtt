00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.070
So we are now ready to define

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.612
Bayes networks in a more general way.

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:08.540
Bayes networks define probability distributions over graphs of random variables.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.465
Here's an example of a graph of

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:15.137
five variables and this Bayes network

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:18.350
defines the distribution over those five random variables.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.715
Instead of enumerating all possibilities of combinations of these five random variables,

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.215
the Bayes network is defined by

00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:30.945
probability distributions that are inherent to each individual node.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.590
For node A and B we just have a distribution,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.160
P(A) and P(B) because A and B have no incoming arcs.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400
C is defined as a condition distribution,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.060
conditioned on A and B.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.400
And D and E are conditioned on C.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.035
The joint probability represented by a Bayes network is

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:58.330
the product of various Bayes network probabilities

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.780
that are defined over individual nodes,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
but each node's probability is only conditioned on the incoming arcs.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.510
So A has no incoming arc,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.685
therefore we just want the probability of A.

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:11.950
C has two incoming arcs,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.080
so if we define the probability of C conditioned A and B.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.725
And D and E have one incoming arc as shown over here.

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:23.040
The definition of this joint distribution by using

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.340
the following factors has one really big advantage.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.499
Whereas the joint distribution over any five variables

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:39.960
requires two to the five minus one which is 31 probability values.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.950
The Bayes network over here only requires 10 such values P(A)

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.650
specific of one value from which we can derive P of not A, same for P(B).

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.760
P (C) given AB is derived by a distribution over

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.240
C conditioned on any combination of A and B of which there are four if A and B is binary.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.931
P(D) given C has two parameters.

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:11.580
For P(D) given C and P(D) given not C and the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.660
same is true for P(E) given C. So if you add those up,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.030
you get 10 parameters in total.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.360
So the compactness of the Bayes network leads to a representation that's clearly

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.310
significantly better to large networks than

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.175
the combinatorial approach which goes to all combinations of variable values.

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:36.492
That is a key advantage of Bayes networks and that is the reason that Bayes networks

00:02:36.492 --> 00:02:41.200
have been used so extensively for all kinds of problems.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.685
So here's a quiz.

00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:45.840
So how many probability values are required to specify this Bayes network?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.580
Please put your answer on the wall.
