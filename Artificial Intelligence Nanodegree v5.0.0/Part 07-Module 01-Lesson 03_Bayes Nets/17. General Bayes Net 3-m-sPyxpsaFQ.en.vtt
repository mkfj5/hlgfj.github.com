00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.589
And here's our car network which we
discussed at the very beginning of this

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.229
unit.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.775
How many parameters do we
need to specify this network?

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:14.507
Remember, there are 16
total variables and

00:00:14.507 --> 00:00:22.890
the naive join over those 16 will
be 2 to the 16- 1, which is 65,535.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.879
Please write your answer
into this box over here.
