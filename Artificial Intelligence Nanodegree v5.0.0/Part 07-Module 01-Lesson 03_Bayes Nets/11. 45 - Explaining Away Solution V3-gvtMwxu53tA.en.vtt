00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.487
The answer is approximately 0.0142.

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:10.266
And as an exercise in expanding
this term using Bayes' rule,

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:14.120
using total probability,
which I just do for you.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.945
Using Bayes' rule,
you can transform this into P of H,

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:26.763
given R, S times P of R
given S over P of H given S.

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:30.487
You observe the position
independence of R and S,

00:00:30.487 --> 00:00:33.539
to simplify this to just P of R.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.866
And the denominator is expanded
by folding in R and not R.

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:44.821
You have (H | R,S) times
P(R) plus P(H|-RS)

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:49.870
times P(-R) which is total probability.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.756
You can now read off the numbers
from the tables over here,

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:59.945
which gives us 1 times 0.01
divided by this expression is

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:06.057
the same as the expression over here
0.01 plus this thing over here.

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:10.522
Which we can find over here
to be 0.7 x this one over

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:15.097
here which is one minus
the value over here 0.99.

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:19.751
Which gives us approximately 0.0142
