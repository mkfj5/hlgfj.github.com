00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:04.556
So now we've learned about independence
and the corresponding Bayes network has

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:07.130
two nodes,
they're just not connected at all.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.378
And we learned about
conditional independence,

00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:12.007
in which case we have a Bayes
network that looks like this.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:16.896
Now I would like to know whether
absolute independence implies

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:20.410
conditional independence, true or false?

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.012
And I'd also like to know whether
conditional independence implies

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:25.385
absolute independence.

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:27.189
Again, true or false?
