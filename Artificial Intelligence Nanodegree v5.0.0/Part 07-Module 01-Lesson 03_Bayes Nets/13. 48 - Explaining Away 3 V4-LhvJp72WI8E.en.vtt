00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.629
And if you got this right,

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.469
I will be deeply impressed on
the fact you got this right.

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:10.809
My happiness is well explained
by the fact that sunny.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.769
So if someone observes you to
be happy and asks the question,

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.739
is this because Sebastian
got a raise at work?

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.299
Well If you know it's sunny and
this is a fairly good explanation for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.230
me being happy.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.830
You don't have to assume I got a raise.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.507
If you don't know about the weather,

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:33.790
then obviously the chances are higher
that the raise caused my happiness.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.273
And therefore this number
goes up from 0.014 to 0.018.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:44.276
Let me ask you one final
question in this next quiz which

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:50.822
is the probability of a raise given
that I look happy and it's not sunny.

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:55.398
This is the most extreme case for
making a raise likely because

00:00:55.398 --> 00:01:00.640
I am a happy guy and it's definitely
not caused by the weather.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.299
So it could be just random or
it could be caused by the raise.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.259
So please calculate this number for
me and enter it into this box.
