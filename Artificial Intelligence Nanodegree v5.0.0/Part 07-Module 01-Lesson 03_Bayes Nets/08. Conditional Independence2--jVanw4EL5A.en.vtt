00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.099
So let me draw the cancer
example again with two tests.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.796
Here's my cancer variable, and

00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:12.529
there's two condition independent tests,
T1 and T2.

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.019
And as before let me assume that
the probability of cancer is 0.01.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.359
What I want you to compute for
me Is the probability

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:30.009
of the second test to be positive if we
know that the first test was positive.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.320
So write this into the following box.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.018
