00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.884
The answer is surprisingly simple.

00:00:02.884 --> 00:00:08.240
It is 0.01, but
how do you know this so fast?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.359
Well, if we look at this
Bayes Network both the sunny and

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:17.079
the question whether they got
a raise impact my happiness.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:22.239
But since I don't know anything about
the happiness there's no way that

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:28.259
just the weather might impact
whether I get a raise or not.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.548
In fact,
it might be independently sunny and

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:35.229
might independently get a raise at work.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:41.349
There's no mechanism of which
these two things would co-occur.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.240
Therefore the probability of
a raise given it is sunny,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.499
is just the same as the probability of
a raise given any weather which is 0.01.
