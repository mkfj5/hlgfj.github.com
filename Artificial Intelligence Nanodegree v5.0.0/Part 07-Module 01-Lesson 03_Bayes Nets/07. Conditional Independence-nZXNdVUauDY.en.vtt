00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.326
I want to use a few
words of terminology.

00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:08.347
This again is a Bayes network
of which the hidden variable

00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:13.382
C causes the still stochastic
test outcomes T1 and T2.

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:18.253
And what's really important is that
we assume not just that T1 and

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.870
T2 are identically distributed.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.520
It is the same 0.9 for
test one that I used for test two.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.059
But we also assume that they
are conditionally independent.

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:36.109
We assumed that if God told us
whether we actually had cancer or not.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.432
If you would ask with certainty
the breakup of variable C that knowing

00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:46.408
anything about T1 would not help
us make a statement about T2.

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:52.135
But differently we assumed that
the probability of T2 given C and

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:56.415
T1 is the same as
the probability of T2 given C.

00:00:56.415 --> 00:01:01.780
This is called conditional
independence which is given

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.799
the value of the cancer variable C,
if you do this for

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.759
fact that T2 would be independent of T1.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
It's conditionally independent because
independence only holds true

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.159
if we actually know C.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.159
And it comes out of
this diagram over here.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.159
If we look at this diagram,
if we knew the variable C over

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.149
here, then C separately causes T1 and
T2.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.757
So as a result,
if we know C whatever over here,

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:41.356
it's kind of cut off, categorically
from what happens over here.

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:47.109
That causes these two variables
to be conditionally independent.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.626
So conditional independence is
a really big thing for Bayes network.

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:54.837
Here's a Bayes network
where A causes B and C.

00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:58.750
And for Bayes network of this structure,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.540
we know that given A,
B and C are independent.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.389
It's written as B condition
independent of C given A.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.811
So here's a question, suppose we have
conditional independence between B and

00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:13.950
C given A.

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:20.359
Would then imply, and that's my
question, that B and C are independent?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.620
So, suppose we don't know A.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.072
We don't know whether we have cancer,
for example.

00:02:25.072 --> 00:02:30.188
Would that mean that the test results,
individually, yet still independent

00:02:30.188 --> 00:02:34.542
of each other, even if we don't
know about the cancer situation?

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:35.564
Please answer yes or no.
