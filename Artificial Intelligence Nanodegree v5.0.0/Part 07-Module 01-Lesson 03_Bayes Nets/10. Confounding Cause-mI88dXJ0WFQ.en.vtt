00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.679
For my next example, I will study
a different type of a Bayes network.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:07.837
Before we've seen networks
of the following type,

00:00:07.838 --> 00:00:12.370
where a single, hidden cause
caused two different measurements.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.599
I now want to study a network that
looks just like the opposite.

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.109
We have two independent,
hidden causes, but

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.059
they get confounded within a single,
observational variable.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:28.119
I would like to use
the example of happiness.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.079
Suppose I can be happy or unhappy.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.156
What makes me happy is
when the weather is sunny,

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:41.039
or if I get a raise at my job,
which means I make more money.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.600
So let's call this sunny, let's call
this a raise and call this happiness.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.092
Perhaps, the probability
of it being sunny is 0.7.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:57.279
The probability of a raise is 0.01.

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:03.290
And I will tell you if the probability
of being happy is governed as follows.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.811
The probability of being happy given
that both of these things occur,

00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:11.721
I got a raise and it's sunny, is 1.

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:16.687
The probability of being happy
given that it is not sunny and

00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:19.376
I still got a raise, is 0.9.

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:23.591
The probability of being happy
given that it is sunny, but

00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:26.185
I didn't give a raise, is 0.7.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.855
And the probability of being happy,

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:33.774
given that it is neither sunny nor
did I get their raise, is 0.1.

00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:39.379
This is a perfectly fine specification
of a probability distribution

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:44.612
where two causes affect the variable
down here, the happiness.

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:48.222
So I'd like you to calculate for
me the following questions.

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:54.950
The probability of a raise given that
it is sunny, according to this model.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.900
