00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.569
So it takes 47 numerical
probabilities to specify

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.839
the joint compared to 65,000 if
we didn't have the structure.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.439
I think this example really illustrates
the advantage of compact Bayes network

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:16.750
representations.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.719
Over unstructured joint representations.
