00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.762
And let me talk about
a really interesting and

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:09.374
special instance of Bayes Net Reasoning
which is called explaining away.

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:12.915
And I'll first give you
the intuitive answer, and

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:15.961
then I wish you to
compute probabilities for

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.589
me that manifest the explain away
effect in Bayes Net of this type.

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.512
Explaining away means that,
if we know that we are happy,

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:31.178
then sunny weather can explain
away the cause of happiness.

00:00:31.178 --> 00:00:33.100
If I then also know that it's sunny,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.460
it becomes less likely
that I received a raise.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.759
So let me put this differently, suppose
I'm a happy guy on a specific day, and

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:45.019
my wife asks me, Sebastian,
why are you so happy?

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.920
Is it sunny, or did you get a raise?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.504
If she then looks outside and
sees it's sunny,

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:55.104
then she might explain to herself, well,
Sebastian is happy because it's sunny.

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:59.037
It makes it effectively,
less likely that he got a raise,

00:00:59.037 --> 00:01:03.909
because I could already explain
this happiness by it being sunny.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.082
If she looks outside and it's rainy,
it makes it more likely I got a raise,

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:13.117
because the weather can't
really explain my happiness.

00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:18.260
In other words, if you see a certain
effect that it could be caused

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.935
by multiple causes,
seeing one of those causes can explain

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:27.439
away any other potential cause
of this effect over here.

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:32.253
So let me put this in numbers, and
ask you the challenging question of

00:01:32.254 --> 00:01:37.410
what's the probability of the raise
given I'm happy, and it's sunny?
