00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.389
So we want to draw Bayes rule rapidly.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.830
We have a situation where we
have an internal variable A,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.669
like whether or not we have cancer.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.519
But we can't sense A,

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.179
instead we have a second variable
called B, which is our test.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.329
And B is observable, but A isn't.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.089
This is a classical
example of a Base network.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.129
The base network is composed
of two variables A and B.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:32.210
We know the prior probability for A and

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.070
we know the conditional
A causes B whether or

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.730
not the cancer causes the test
result to be positive or not.

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.589
Although with some randomness involved.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.750
So we know about the probability of
B given the different values for A.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.159
And what we care about in this specific
instance is called diagnostic reasoning.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.479
Which is inverse of
the causal reasoning.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:04.289
Probability of A given B, or similarly,
probability of A given off B.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
This is our very first Bayes Network and
the graphical representation

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.700
of drawn two variables, A and
B, connected with an arrow.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.450
Because from A to B is a graphical
representation of distribution of two

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.740
variables that specified the structure
of a prior probability.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:29.379
And has a conditional
probability which is normal.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:32.219
Now I do have a quick quiz for you.

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.689
How many parameters does it
take to specify the entire

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.439
joint probability between A and
B or the entire Bayes Network?

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.439
I'm not looking for
a structural parameters.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.380
We look to the graph over here,
just looking for

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.219
the numerical parameters of
the underlying probabilities.
