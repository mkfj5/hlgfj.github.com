00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.887
And the answer is,
both of them are false.

00:00:02.887 --> 00:00:07.089
We already saw that conditional
independence, as shown over here,

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:09.702
doesn't give us absolute independence.

00:00:09.702 --> 00:00:12.748
So, for example, this is test
number one and test number two,

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.482
you might or might not have cancer.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:18.225
Our first test gives us information
about whether you have cancer or not.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:21.808
And as a result,
you've changed our prior probability for

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.410
the second test to come in positive.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.240
That means conditional independence
does not imply absolute independence,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.759
which renders this assumption,
here, false.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.329
And as it also turns out that if
you have absolute independence,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.039
things might not be
conditionally independent for

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.060
reasons that can't quite explain so
far but that we will learn about next.
