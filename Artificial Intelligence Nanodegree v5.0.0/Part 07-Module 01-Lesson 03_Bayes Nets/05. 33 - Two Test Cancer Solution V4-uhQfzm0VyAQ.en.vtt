00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.092
So the correct answer is 0.1698

00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:10.525
approximately.

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:15.370
And to compute this,
I used the trick I've shown you before.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.550
Let me write down the running count for
cancer, and

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.032
for not cancer, as I integrate
the various multiplications in Bayes rule.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:34.936
My prior for cancer was 0.01,
and for non-cancer was 0.99.

00:00:34.936 --> 00:00:36.948
Then I get my first +, and

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:41.710
the probability of a plus given
that we have cancer is 0.9.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.593
And the same for non cancer is 0.2.

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:49.987
So according to
the non-normalized Bayes rule,

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:54.623
I now multiply these two things
together to get my non-normalized

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:58.679
probability of having
cancer given the plus.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.639
Since multiplication is commutative,

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:07.126
I can do the same thing again with
my second test result, 0.9, 0.2.

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:11.867
And I multiply all of these three things
together to get my non normalized

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.911
probability, P prime,
to be the following.

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.478
0.0081 if you multiply
those things together.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:25.539
And 0.0396 if you multiply
these guys together.

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.560
And these are not a probability.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.314
If we add those for
the two complementary,

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:35.602
with cancer, non cancer, I get 0.0477.

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:37.973
However, I now divide.

00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:42.413
That is, I normalize those non
normalized probabilities over

00:01:42.412 --> 00:01:44.920
here by this factor over here.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.409
I actually get the correct
posterior probability.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.055
P(C) given ++.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:55.872
And they look as follows,
approximately 0.1698 and

00:01:55.873 --> 00:01:59.021
approximately 0.8301.
