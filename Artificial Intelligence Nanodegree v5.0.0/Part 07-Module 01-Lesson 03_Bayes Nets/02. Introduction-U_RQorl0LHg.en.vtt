00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.940
Sebastian, why are Bayes Nets important?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.781
&gt;&gt; They're one of the most amazing
accomplishments of recent artificial

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.910
intelligence.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.509
They take the idea of uncertainty and
probability and

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.900
marry it with efficient structures.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.155
So you don't have a big mumble jumble
but you can really understand,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:20.014
like what uncertain variable
influences other uncertain variable.

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:25.579
A theory of the world using just
Bayes Networks is really an amazing.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.869
&gt;&gt; Well, I've been teaching AI for
many years, I've found that listening to

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.590
Sebastian's lessons has really given
me a better intuition for Bayes Nets.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:37.129
As you go through these lessons,
make sure to understand how to construct

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.080
a Bayes Nets and
how to do inference with them.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.810
One of my favorite algorithms
is Monte Carlo Markov Chain.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.480
Have fun with the lesson.
