The next concept I'd like to
teach you is called D-Separation.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.679
And let me start the discussion
of this concept by a quiz.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.410
We have here a Bayes network and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.160
then when we ask to conditional
independence question.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.301
Is C independent of A,
please tell me yes or no.

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:24.478
Is C independent of A given B,
is C independent of D,

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:30.736
is C independent of D given A, and
is E independent of C given D.

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:32.588
