00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:03.125
To answer this question,
let us add up these numbers.

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:08.108
[INAUDIBLE] is 1, 1, 1,
this is one incoming arc, so

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:11.599
it's 2, two incoming arc makes 4,

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.128
one incoming arc is 2, 2 equals 4.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.954
Four incoming arcs make 16,
we add all these numbers we get 47.
