00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:04.220
What if I want to make a computer player
for a stochastic game, like Backgammon?

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.152
&gt;&gt; Well, in Backgammon,

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:08.830
your moves are limited each turn
based on the roles of two dice.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.260
Since you can't know the result
of the dice ahead of time,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.210
it would seem at first that you
can't do a game-tree for it.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.360
In actuality, you can.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.110
And then use an algorithm
called expect to max,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.130
to make best-choice
decisions on your moves.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.940
To show how we handle
probabilistic games,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.410
I've invented a variant of
isolation I call sloppy isolation.
