00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.450
To show how probabilistic games work,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.190
I've invented a version of
isolation called Sloppy Isolation.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.970
In this game, players may not
actually move where they intended.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.177
For example,
if our player is trying to go to here,

00:00:13.177 --> 00:00:16.989
it only has an 80% chance of
hitting the square intended.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:20.450
There's a 10% chance the player
will undershoot its goal.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.440
And there's a 10% chance the computer
player will overshoot its goal.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.560
But suppose the computer player is in a
place where moving is very constrained.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.980
For example, here,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.230
if the computer player is moving to the
right, it can't go beyond the border.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.850
In that case, there's 100% chance
it'll land on the intended square.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.210
If the computer player is trying to move
to the last square here, there's a 90%

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.680
chance of it hitting its intended square
and a 10% chance of it falling short.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.126
Similarly, if our computer player is
just trying to move over by one, there's

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:59.855
a 90% chance it will hit the square
once and a 10% chance it will overshoot.
