00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.940
The next question is whether alpha
beta can work with multi-player games.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.199
&gt;&gt; Well according to a paper by Korff,
pruning can work as long as sum of

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.490
the values the players' evaluation
functions has an upper bound and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.570
each player's value,
you have lower bound.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.890
&gt;&gt; Well for our number of mine moves 
evaluation function for isolation zero

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.929
is a natural lower bound, but what would
make a good upper bound for the sum?

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.780
&gt;&gt; If an evaluation function could
estimate the number of total moves

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.060
remaining for each player, it would work
because the sum of the number of total

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.554
moves should not exceed the number of
empty squares of the isolation board.

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:35.844
For example, with this board, the limit
should be 22 or around 7 per player.

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:37.324
&gt;&gt; That's fine in theory but

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.725
but the upper bound would change with
each level of the game tree.

00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:43.632
Can't we simplify things for
illustration purposes?

00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:47.292
&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll say that the sum of
players' scores can't exceed ten and,

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:50.822
to make things even easier, we'll say
that the sum has to equal exactly ten.

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:52.452
&gt;&gt; And that's going to allow pruning?

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:52.991
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.621
And we'll show you an example that
allows both immediate pruning and

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.900
shallow pruning.

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.771
&gt;&gt; Does that mean we can't
do deep pruning like before?

00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:01.591
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately that's correct.

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:02.861
While some pruning is possible,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.161
deep pruning like what alpha beta
allowed before isn't possible.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:09.239
&gt;&gt; Okay so
show me an example of immediate pruning.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.390
Let's look at the left most
bottom branch of the search tree.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.590
Since we know that the maximum value
is ten there is no point in evaluating

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.350
the next two branches to the right.

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:20.849
They can return at most ten and
we already have that option.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:23.829
We can safely ignore them and
propagate the values of the tree.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:24.329
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.359
And I guess we can put limits on what
values will be at the top most node.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.189
However, in this case it doesn't help.

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.549
The value of player one could
be anywhere from zero to ten.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.439
The other ones will be less than ten.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.590
&gt;&gt; But the middle branch
would limit things a bit and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.634
we will see an example of shallow
pruning for the right branch.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.459
At the bottom level
of the middle branch,

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.849
player two will pick
the left most option.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:48.379
Now we see player one will have a value
greater than or equal to three.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.859
And since the sum has to be ten,

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.599
each of the others are limited to
values less than or equal to seven.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.530
&gt;&gt; But in the next branch over,
player two will get a seven or better.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.189
Which means that player one
will get a three or less.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.409
Since we already have a three,
we can prune this last branch.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.829
It's values will not matter,

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.090
because we're going to choose
the option we already have.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.150
&gt;&gt; Now you see it.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.950
Let's have a quiz and
work another example.
