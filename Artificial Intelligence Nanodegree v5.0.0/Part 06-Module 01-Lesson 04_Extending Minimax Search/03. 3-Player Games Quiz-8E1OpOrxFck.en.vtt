00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.960
Fill in the values of this
three-player game tree,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.880
which alternates levels between players.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.840
The values of each
node are in the order,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.040
player one score, player two score,
and player three score.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.180
Each agent tries to
maximize their own score,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.490
so will propagate up the values
based on which agent's move it is.
