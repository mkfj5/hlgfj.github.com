00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.780
Each agent tries to
maximize its own score, so

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.190
we propagate up the values based
on which agent's move it is.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.200
We start with agent 3's level.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Here agent 3 has a choice between
a 1 and a 2, so it'll choose the 2.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.660
Then it has a 3 and a 4,
so it'll choose the 4.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.660
Then it chooses between the 5 and
the 6, so it'll take the 6.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920
And then a 7 and a 8,
so it'll take the 8.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.293
Next is a player 2 level.

00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:28.712
Player 2 is choosing between a 7 and
a 5 ,so it's going to take the 7.

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:31.920
And then a 3 and a 1,
so it'll take the 3.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.370
Finally, it's player 1's turn.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.064
And player 1 will choose
the 7 when compared to a 1.
