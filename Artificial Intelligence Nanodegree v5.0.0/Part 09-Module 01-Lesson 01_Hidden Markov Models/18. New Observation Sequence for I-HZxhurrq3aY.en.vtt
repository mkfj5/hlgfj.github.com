00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.740
Let's look at a new
observation sequence.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.916
We've replaced the middle 0 observation
with a new sequence -1 0 and 1.

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:12.222
Given these probabilities,
can you tell us the probability of this

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:14.550
observation sequence,
given the model for I?
