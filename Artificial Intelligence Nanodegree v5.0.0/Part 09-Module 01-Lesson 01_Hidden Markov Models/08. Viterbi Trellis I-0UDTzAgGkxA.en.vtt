00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.299
So how do we actually go about
performing recognition with the models

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:04.650
we just created?

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.300
&gt;&gt; Suppose we have
a set of observations,

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.649
O, that represent the samples in
an example we want to recognize.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.047
We'll create something called the
Viterbi Trellis to see how likely each

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.644
model generated the samples in O.

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:18.451
The one that gives us the highest
probability will be considered

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:19.945
the proper match.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.214
However, we don't know the exact
sequence of states that created

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:24.285
the output.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:27.975
Those are hidden, so we'll need to
go through all the possibilities.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:31.920
&gt;&gt; That sounds like it would be long,
but maybe we can simplify it as we go.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.890
&gt;&gt; Okay, here's the sequence of delta ys
we collected in the example we want to

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.039
recognize as I or we.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.240
&gt;&gt; So our overall goal is to
find P of O given lambda I or

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.150
the probability of our observation
sequence given our model of I.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.399
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.059
Here's how we start the trellis.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.850
We have one row for
each state in the model and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.179
we want to look at which state
we're in at each time step.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:59.299
&gt;&gt; Well at the beginning we have
to start in state 1, correct?

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.250
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, then at t equal to 2,
we can stay in state 1 or

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.480
transition to state 2, but
we can't reach state 3 yet.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.450
Looks like we've already
eliminated some of this trellis.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.100
&gt;&gt; Yes, the transition
probabilities in these models

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.519
really limit where you
can be at any given time.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:16.979
Perhaps we can have a quiz on that idea.
