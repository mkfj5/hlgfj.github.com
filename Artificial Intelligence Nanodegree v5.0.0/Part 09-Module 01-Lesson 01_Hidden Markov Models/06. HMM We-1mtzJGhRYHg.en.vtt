00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.726
Great, now here's the HMM I created for
the gesture, we.

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:06.514
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:07.319
&gt;&gt; Hold on.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.990
I would have used four states here.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.380
Why did you only use three?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.390
&gt;&gt; Well it was mostly to simplify
the problem for our purposes.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.740
Note that the middle section varies
a little bit more in delta y than with

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.639
the middle state of I.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.219
And we spend more time in
the middle state as well.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.619
&gt;&gt; I see, it looks like the transition
probabilities have changed to reflect

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.640
this, right?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.070
&gt;&gt; Correct,
we spend longer in that state, so

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.370
we have a higher probability
in the self loop.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.480
Also, we have more variation in
the delta y in this gesture,

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.019
which leads to a wider, and
shorter, output distribution.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.050
&gt;&gt; This seems like a good time for
a short quiz.
