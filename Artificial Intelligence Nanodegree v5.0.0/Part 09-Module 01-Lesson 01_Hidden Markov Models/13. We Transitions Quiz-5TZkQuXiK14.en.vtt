Now it's your turn.

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.440
Can you tell us the most probable path
through the trellis for the model of we?

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.650
We'll start small.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.199
Check the boxes between states to
indicate which state transitions can

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:11.119
occur.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.719
For example, check this box to show that
state two can transition to state three.
