00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.669
Okay, I've made an HMM for
sign language word, I.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.990
&gt;&gt; Great, how did you pick those states?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.730
&gt;&gt; Well, the gesture seemed like
it had three separate motions.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.870
So, I made each of those
their own state and

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.869
chose the transition probabilities
based on the timing.

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.629
&gt;&gt; We can take a look at
the observed delta y here

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:18.939
to check to see if
the model is reasonable.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.760
First, the arm comes up towards
the chest, and then pauses for

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.230
a moment and then goes back down again.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.630
We can see that we spend a lot of
time in states one and three, so

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.769
there's a high probability
on their self loops.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.420
State two is short so
we've given it a smaller probability.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.270
&gt;&gt; Right, then we can fill in the output
probability distribution similarly.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.621
For example in state two,

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:45.810
we have a higher probability
of getting a delta y of zero.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.981
We use Gaussian to model the upper
probabilities here since they have nice

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:49.609
properties.
