00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.378
Here's the resulting probability for
We, 2.91 x 10 to the -5.

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:08.628
Note that this answer is higher than
what we got for the model of i.

00:00:08.628 --> 00:00:12.115
Indicating that this observation
sequence probably came from a We

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:12.679
gesture.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.663
This is a different result
from what we saw previously.

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:19.190
Showing how the additional time spent
in the middle state maps better to our

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.869
model for We.
