00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.899
Now let's do the same thing for We.

00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.890
We have the same observation
sequence as the previous quiz, where

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:09.939
the middle zero was replaced with the
sequence negative one, zero, and one.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.009
We've given you new probabilities for
We.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.980
So go ahead and tell us the probability
of this observation sequence

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.010
given our model for We.
