00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.070
So what's next?

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; A process called
Baum Welch re-estimation.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.040
&gt;&gt; That's like
Expectation-maximization again, right?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.879
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:10.240
&gt;&gt; But how does it differ
from what we just did?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.280
&gt;&gt; It's very similar, but

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.649
with Baum Welch, every sample of
the data contributes to every state

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.550
proportionally to the probability of
that frame of data being in that state.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.394
So you're saying that even though this
9 here is most likely in state one,

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:27.929
its values still effects state two and
three.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.480
&gt;&gt; But only a little bit because its
likelihood of belonging to states two

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.200
and three is pretty low.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.890
&gt;&gt; But for data like this 2 here,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.950
it has a high likelihood of
being in state one or state two.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.310
&gt;&gt; And thus, has a bigger influence
on the final output probabilities for

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.310
those states than for state three.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.289
&gt;&gt; Okay, that doesn't sound so
bad in theory.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.183
But it sounds hard to calculate
because you have to weigh everything

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:48.989
appropriately.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.500
&gt;&gt; It's actually not that bad.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.159
We can use the forward-backward
algorithm to help keep track of

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.529
the calculations.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.179
And it's worth the effort,
because the final model often gives

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.439
better results than
our initial estimate.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.549
&gt;&gt; Now that we've given
the intuition for what is going on,

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.069
there are several good writeup's
on the details of Baum Welch.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.990
Tutorial is a classic reference, and
Thad's master thesis has an explanation

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.199
that continues with
the sign language example.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.495
Or just looking at the code to a popular
HMM toolkit like HTK can be useful, too.

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:19.465
In any case, using one of these
toolkits and watching the means and

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.695
variants change as the re-estimation
process iterates will help

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:25.054
build further intuition,
and we highly suggest it.
