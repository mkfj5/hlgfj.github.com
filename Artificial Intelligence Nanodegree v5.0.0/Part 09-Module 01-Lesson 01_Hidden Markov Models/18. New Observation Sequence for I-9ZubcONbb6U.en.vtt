00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.790
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.410
By multiplying all the transition and

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.310
output probabilities, along with
the curvy path and the new trellis,

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.954
we get the resulting probability for
I 1.42 X 10 to the negative 5th.
