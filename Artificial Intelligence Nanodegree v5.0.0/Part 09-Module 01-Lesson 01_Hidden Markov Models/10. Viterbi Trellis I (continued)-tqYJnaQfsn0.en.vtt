00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.390
In the middle of the trellis it looks
like we have many more options.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.810
We could really be in
any of the three states.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:06.699
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.961
The next thing we need to do is
to add transition probabilities.

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:14.926
We can pull those directly
from our model, lambda I.

00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:18.655
&gt;&gt; Okay, I have added the transition
probabilities, that seems simple enough.

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:22.259
But how do we go from this
to an overall probability?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.970
&gt;&gt; Here's where our
observation sequence comes in.

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:26.929
Let's look at time step 1.

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.009
We saw a delta y of 3, but we know we
can only be in state 1 at that time.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.329
By looking at the output
distribution at state 1,

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.619
we can see how probable
it is to get a 3 from it.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.259
Normally, we would have a real
distribution for these outputs.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:44.500
And we could find the actual
probability for the output.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.939
But for illustration purposes,
I'll pick some reasonable numbers.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:51.037
As long as we're consistent
the example should work.

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:55.743
I'll call the probability that
the Gaussian in the first state

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:58.598
generated a delta y of 3 to be 0.5.

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.269
So let's write that into this node.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.990
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.254
So then for
time 2 we have an output of 7.

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:08.704
3 was two away from state 1's mean of 5.

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:10.575
And 7 is also two away from 5.

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:14.005
So it will be a probability
of 0.5 here as well.

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:14.894
&gt;&gt; That works.

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:17.640
Now we also need to consider state 2.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.819
But the probability of getting a seven
there is very small, nearly zero, but

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:22.869
not quite.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.939
So let's say, 10 to the -7.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.799
&gt;&gt; Why don't we pause for a quiz to
make sure this process makes sense?
