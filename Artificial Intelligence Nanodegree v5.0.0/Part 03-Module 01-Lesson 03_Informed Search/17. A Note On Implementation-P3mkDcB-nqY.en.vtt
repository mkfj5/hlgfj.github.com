00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.734
Our description of the algorithm has
talked about paths in the state space.

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:10.208
I want to say a little bit now about how
to implement that in terms of a computer

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:11.000
algorithm.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.170
We talk about paths, but we want to
implement that in some ways and

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.160
the implementation we talk about nodes.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.620
A node is a data structure and
it has four fields.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.469
A state field indicates the state
at the end of the path.

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.739
A action was the action
it took to get there.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.589
The cost is the total cost and
the parent is a pointer to another node.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.304
In this case,
the node that has state S and

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:51.884
it will have a parent which points
to the node that has state A and

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:56.496
that will have a parent
pointer that's no.

00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:01.546
So, we have linked list of
nodes representing the path.

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:05.783
We'll use the word path for
the abstract idea and the word node for

00:01:05.784 --> 00:01:08.725
the representation in
the computer memory.

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:12.221
But otherwise, you can think of
those two terms as being synonyms,

00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:14.805
because they're in a one
to one correspondence.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.320
Now, there are two main data
structures that deal with nodes.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.437
We have the frontier and
we have the explored list.

00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:26.317
So, let's talk about
how to implement them.

00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:31.212
In the frontier, the operations we have
to deal with are removing the best item

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:33.817
from the frontier and
adding in new ones.

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:38.807
And that suggests, we should implement
it as a priority queue which knows how

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:42.107
to keep track of the best
items in proper order, but

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:46.433
we also need to have an additional
operation of a membership test.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:49.420
Is a new item in the frontier?

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.549
And that suggests
representing it as a set,

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.769
which can be built from a hash table or
a tree.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.329
And so, the most efficient
implementations of search

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.010
actually have both representations.

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:05.469
The explored set on
the other hand is easier.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.069
All we have to do there is be able
to add new members and check for

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.180
membership.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.290
And so we represent that as
a single set which again,

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.729
can be done with either a hash table or
a tree.
