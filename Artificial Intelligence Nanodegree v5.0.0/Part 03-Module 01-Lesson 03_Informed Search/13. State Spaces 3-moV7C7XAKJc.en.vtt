00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.862
The answer is that the number of states
is the crossproduct of the numbers of

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:08.004
all the variables,
since they're each independent and

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:09.586
any combination can occur.

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:13.470
So for the power,
we have three possible positions.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.800
The camera has two,
the Brush Height has five.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.513
The dirt has two for
each of the ten positions.

00:00:22.513 --> 00:00:25.907
So that's 2 to the tenth, or 1,024.

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:31.969
And then the robot's position can be
any of those ten positions as well.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.564
And that works out to 307,200
states in the state space.

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:41.275
And notice how a fairly trivial problem,
we're only modeling a few variables and

00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:44.836
only ten positions works out to
a large number of state space.

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:48.736
And that's why we need efficient algorithms
for searching through state spaces.
