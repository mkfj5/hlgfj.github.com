00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Now we expand Fagaras,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
and we get a path that reaches the goal,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.939
and it has a path length of 450 and an estimated distance of

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:13.094
zero for a total F value of 450.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.655
Now the question is,

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:16.780
what do we do next?
