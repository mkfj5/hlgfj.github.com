00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.939
The answer is that it
depends on the h function.

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.774
A* will find the lowest cost
path if the h function for

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:16.099
a state is less than the true cost of
the path to the goal through that state.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.230
In other words, we want the h to never
overestimate the distance to the goal.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.089
We also say that h is optimistic.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.519
Another way of stating that
is that h is admissible,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.200
meaning that it's admissible to use
it to find the lowest cost path.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.340
So think of all of these
as being the same way

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.010
of stating the conditions under
which A* finds the lowest cost path.
