00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.220
In this unit, we're going to
talk about problem solving.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.972
The theory and

00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:07.674
technology of building agents that
can plan ahead to solve problems.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:11.658
In particular, we're talking about
problem solving where the complexity of

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:14.690
the problem comes from the idea
that there are many states.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.554
As in this problem here, a navigation
problem where there are many choices to

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:25.056
start with and the complexity comes
from picking the right choice now and

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:28.377
picking the right choice at
the next intersection and

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:33.058
the intersection after that, stringing
together a sequence of actions.

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:36.975
This is in contrast to the type of
complexity shown in this picture where

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.896
the complexity comes from the partial
observability that we can't see

00:00:40.896 --> 00:00:43.459
through the fog where
the possible paths are.

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:45.665
We can't see the results
of our actions and

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.679
even the actions
themselves are not known.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.369
This type of complexity will
be covered in a later unit.

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:54.532
Here's an example of a problem.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.804
This is a route-finding problem
where we're given a start city.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:02.469
In this case, Arad and
a destination, Bucharest,

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.801
the capital of Romania from which
this is a corner of the map and

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:10.966
the problem them is to find
a route from Arad to Bucharest and

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:15.549
the actions that the agent can
execute are driving from one city to

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.917
the next along one of
the roads shown on the map.

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:23.314
The question is, is there a solution
that the agent can come up with given

00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:27.869
the knowledge shown here to the problem
of driving from Arad to Bucharest?
