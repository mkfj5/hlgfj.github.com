00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.160
That problem is going to be
the focus for this lesson.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.759
We need to be able to
handle classes of signals,

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.900
where each example may be warped
in time a bit differently.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.359
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, for features,

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.070
can we just use the whistle
frequencies through time?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.699
&gt;&gt; Normally, that would be a good idea,
but in practice,

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.820
the dolphin's often raise or lower
the basic frequency of the whistle.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.679
What seems to matter is
the pattern of relative rises and

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.689
falls of the whistle through time.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.410
&gt;&gt; In that case,
let's use delta frequency.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.390
Here, instead of 5, 14, 10,
7, 10, and 14 kilohertz,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.881
let's use 9, -4, -3, 3, and 4.
