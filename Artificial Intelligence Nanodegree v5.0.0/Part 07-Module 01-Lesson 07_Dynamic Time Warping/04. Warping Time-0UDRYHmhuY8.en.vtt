00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.430
That will help our recognizer handle the
whistles no matter what frequency they

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.379
start at.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.760
Next let's work on the time warping.

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:11.663
&gt;&gt; Just to be clear you're talking about
the problem where I could draw out your

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:14.894
name saying Fad or
say your name quickly like Fad.

00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:17.419
&gt;&gt; Yep,
that's precisely the problem we have.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.929
But with dolphin whistles, the problem
is easy to see in the spectrogram.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.559
Basically we need to match the features
that make the whistle distinct no matter

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:27.829
if they are drawn out or
produced quickly.
