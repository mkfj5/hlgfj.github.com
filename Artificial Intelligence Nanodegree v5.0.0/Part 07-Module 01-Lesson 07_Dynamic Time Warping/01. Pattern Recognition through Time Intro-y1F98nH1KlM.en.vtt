Thad, we've covered a lot of different
machine learning algorithms.

00:00:02.843 --> 00:00:05.576
But what about situations
where we have time series?

00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:07.569
&gt;&gt; You mean like speech recognition?

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know you've worked
in sign language recognition and

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:11.369
handwriting recognition.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.000
They seem to be similar problems.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.539
&gt;&gt; Yep, they are.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.228
Pattern recognition through
time is one of my specialties.

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:20.253
And it's where the AI community
has made a lot of progress.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:23.257
When you think about it, pattern
recognition through time should be

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:26.520
easier than situations where
you have just one measurement.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.841
&gt;&gt; You mean like how face recognition
is easier when you have a video of

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:31.871
a person, as opposed to a single photo?

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:34.460
If one particular frame of
the video is badly lit or

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.487
the person is looking away
the next frame might be better.

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:38.750
&gt;&gt; Precisely.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.009
But in this section, we are going to
focus on situations where there's

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.670
a language-like
structure to the problem.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.490
In other words, there's some fundamental
unit, like a phoning in speech, or

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.689
letter in handwriting,

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.238
that's combined with other units to
make bigger constructs like words.

00:00:53.238 --> 00:00:56.424
Which are then combined in even
larger structures, like sentences.

00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:59.003
&gt;&gt; So besides speech,
sign language and handwriting,

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:02.500
what other problems have
the same sort of structure?

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.624
&gt;&gt; Well, in my opinion,

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:07.640
most human activities through time
have a language-like structure.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.150
Playing basketball, driving a car, or

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.580
even just vacuuming the floor, all seem
to have similiar units of movement,

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.519
combinations of those movements and
source statistical grammar.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.709
I believe this area of AI is one of
the most promising for future research.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:25.021
I'm excited to share my
knowledge of the subject.

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.441
&gt;&gt; And then we're going to
cover dynamic time warp and

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.397
hidden Markov models in this section.

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:31.088
Where should we start?

00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:34.337
&gt;&gt; Well, let's start with a challenge
question on HMMs that gives a preview of

00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:35.829
what we're going to be learning.
