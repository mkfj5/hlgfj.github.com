00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.879
You always say do the simple thing first
and add intelligence only if necessary.

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.459
What happens if we just do
Euclidean distance here?

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:09.189
&gt;&gt; Let's try it and find out.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.559
Here are some reasonable delta frequency
numbers for the top and bottom graphs.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.199
&gt;&gt; The top time series has 21 samples,
but the bottom one only has 12.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.719
&gt;&gt; How do we do a Euclidean distance?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.200
&gt;&gt; A simple thing to do is
pad the bottom one with 0s.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.230
&gt;&gt; That's reasonable.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.320
Other options would be to fill in with
the average value or the last value, but

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.240
any of these options will work for
our example.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.840
&gt;&gt; Now we can figure out the Euclidean
distance by simply doing the square root

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.480
of the squares of the differences.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.609
Let's see, 0 minus 0 squared is 0,
0 minus 5 squared is 25.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.604
&gt;&gt; And 2 minus 5 squared is 9.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:49.994
And 3 minus 5 squared is 4.

00:00:49.994 --> 00:00:51.924
&gt;&gt; And so on.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:56.614
Doing the math, we get the square root
of 170, which is approximately 13.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:00.685
&gt;&gt; Yep, now let's try using dynamic
time warping through the same problem.
