00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.179
Let's start with a problem I'm currently
exploring, dolphin communication.

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:06.389
Here's a spectrogram
of a dolphin whistle.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:11.019
In actuality, dolphins have several
types of vocalizations, including burst

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.759
pulses and echolocation, but whistles
are the easiest to see in a spectrogram.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.861
&gt;&gt; First,
let's talk about what a spectrogram is.

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:22.492
On this spectrogram, the x-axis is time,
and the y-axis is frequency.

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:26.356
The brightness of the pixels indicate
the amount of power in that frequency

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:26.733
band.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.295
&gt;&gt; Since we are recording in the ocean
there's a lot of noise in the lower

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:31.103
frequencies.

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:34.731
5kHz and lower tends to have
a lot of boat and wave noise.

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:40.228
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; However,

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:46.279
the whistles of the Atlantic spotted
dolphin tend to range from 5kHz-17kHz.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:50.022
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; These whistles can be heard up to 3

00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:51.629
miles away under water.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.900
&gt;&gt; Why do they whistle?

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.640
&gt;&gt; Probably for a lot of reasons.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.799
But one thing we do know is that
dolphins have signature whistles that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.570
act much like our names.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.240
If a dolphin enters a new area and feels
like company, It whistles his signature

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.390
whistle, which helps its friends
know where it is and how to find it.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.540
&gt;&gt; So
what are we seeing in this spectrogram?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.680
&gt;&gt; To me it looks like the same
whistle repeated twice.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.470
The whistle has two parts.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.349
Our task is to be able to recognize
classes of whistles, so that our marine

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:22.209
mammal researchers can automatically
annotate their database of recordings.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.039
&gt;&gt; Well, I see one problem already.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.170
The second time the whistle is repeated,
it seems a little more drawn out.
