Simulated annealing is not often used, but it is a classical algorithm that introduces some important concepts that lead to more modern replacement algorithms like [basin hopping](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.basinhopping.html) and [late acceptance hill climbing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221716305495). The same principles have been used to explain \"[superconvergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120)\" in deep neural networks. Genetic algorithms have already received considerable attention lately for some applications in deep learning. (e.g., [here](https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf))\n\n## Classroom\n- Watch lessons on **Simulated Annealing** and **Genetic Algorithms**\n- (_Optional_) Complete the Optimization classroom exercise\n- (_Optional_) Review the **Additional Topics** lessons with links to optimization software packages and select readings.\n",

When temperature is zero, it will return the current state.\n- Unlike Hill Climbing algorithm which picks the *best* successor, Simulated Annealing will pick a *random* successor from the current state.\n- When the change in temperature is still high, the algorithm will accept any new value from the successor state although the value may become worse.\n- However, as the temperature cools down, the probability of making the transition from current to successor state is specified by the _acceptance probability function_: e<sup>ΔE/T</sup>. As T is approaching zero, the acceptance probability becomes very small.\n\nIn the following lesson, we will look into *Genetic Algorithm*. Similar to Simulated Annealing, the Genetic Algorithm will pick a random successor at each step. However, it has a different evaluation function, called *fitness function*.",
