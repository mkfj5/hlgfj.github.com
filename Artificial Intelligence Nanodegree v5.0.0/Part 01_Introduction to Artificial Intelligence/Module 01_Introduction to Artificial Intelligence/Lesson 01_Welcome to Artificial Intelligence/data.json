              "text": "# Weekly Lesson Plans\nThe classroom content is grouped by topic, but that structure doesn't provide the most clear indication of what content you should cover each week. The AIND program has a set of weekly lesson plans linked within each topic that you can use to plan ahead for your term, and help monitor your progress so that you stay on track to graduate. The links will appear with headings that follow the pattern in the lesson list: **Lesson Plan: Week N**\n\nNote that you are free to work ahead of the lesson plans, and you are **not required** to keep up with the suggested pace. Remember, project deadlines are flexible but the term deadline is not. If you fall behind, you can use the context in the lesson plans to prioritize which lessons are most relevant to completing the projects before your term ends.\n\n\n## Links to each week\nThe lesson plans for this program are embedded directly in the classroom.

The optional readings from the textbook Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach [here](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)—often abbreviated throughout the course as \"AIMA\"—reinforce and expand the topics in the lectures. We will provide copies of any **required** reading material, however you will need to obtain your own copy of the textbook for the _optional_ readings. Prior versions of the book are available through the AIMA site through the link above, and current versions are available for rent or purchase online, or you can check with your library to see if they have access to a copy.\n\n## Classroom\n- Watch the introduction lessons (Welcome to AI, Intro to AI, Setting up Anaconda, Workspaces, & Solving Sudoku with AI)\n - The [References & Resources lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd898/parts/75fe3a30-2531-4040-81e8-c4db62f32c0b/modules/2d1f0742-d727-4993-844b-2a390f9280a7/lessons/31f71698-b09c-44cd-a206-60836cca0e00/concepts/8ca51064-ce48-4ebd-9487-c92c7b0332bc) includes links for Python & Git (which may be useful for project 1)\n- Follow the classroom instructions in Setting up Your Environment to install and configure Anaconda with all the packages and libraries required for the projects and classroom exercises.\n\n- **Complete the first project: Solving Sudoku with AI**\n - You may refer to the AIMA textbook chapter 6.2 Constraint Propagation, and chapter 3.1-3.4 on Search (you will read these chapters more carefully in later weeks -- no need to read them in-depth now)\n\n## Reading\n- (_Optional_) Skim **AIMA Chapter 1 & 2** - these sections introduce some key terms that may be new and that will be used frequently throughout the program\n\n## Announcements\n- The course **refund deadline is the end of the first week** 1 (7 days after the term starts)\n- The first project **Solving Sudoku with AI is due at the end of Week 1**",
