You cannot create your own Workspaces; they have already been pre-configured in the classroom with all the required data, support libraries, and project files.\n\nAll of the projects and classroom exercises in the AIND program have Workspaces available. However, you are **not** required to use the workspaces—all projects and exercises also include instructions for configuring your own local environment with the required files and libraries. Workspaces can be a convenient option, especially if you have any trouble setting up your own environment. \n\nThis lesson is provided as a reference for the Workspaces interface. You do not need to read it all in detail now. Just bookmark the page, and return to it if you choose to use the workspaces and want more information about their capabilities.\n\nThe next lesson will explain the steps you would need to complete in order to configure your own development environment. (You can skip the environment setup if you plan to use the workspaces for all projects.)",

These workspaces provide a Jupyter notebook server directly in your browser. Some workspaces include GPU support, however this option is not enabled for all notebooks and will not be covered in this lesson. This lesson will briefly introduce the basic Workspaces interface.\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- Workspaces sessions are connections from your browser to a remote server. There is currently no time limit imposed on basic Workspaces.\n- Workspace data is preserved between sessions (and can be reset as needed, e.g., to get project updates).\n- Workspace sessions are preserved if your connection drops or your browser window is closed, simply return to the classroom and re-open the workspace page. (NOTE: you may lose data that was not saved before the session was reset.)\n- Workspace sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity.\n- The kernel state is preserved as long as the notebook session remains open, but it is _not_ preserved if the session is closed. If you exit the notebook for more than half an hour and the session is closed, you will need to re-run any previously-run cells before continuing.\n\n## Overview\n---",

              "text": "## Best Practices\n---\nFollow the best practices outlined below to avoid common issues with Workspaces.\n\n- ### Keep your home folder small\n**Your home folder (including subfolders) must be less than 2GB** or you may lose data when your session terminates. You may use directories outside of the home folder for more space, but only the contents of the home folder are persisted between sessions and submitted with your project.\n<br><br>\n**NOTE:** **Your home folder (including subfolders) must be less than 25 megabytes to submit as a project.** If the site becomes unresponsive when you try to submit your project, it is likely that your home folder is too large. You can check the size of your home folder by opening a terminal and running the command `du -h . | tail -1` You can use `ls` to list the files in your terminal and `rm` to remove unwanted files. (Search for both commands online to find example usage.)\n\n  - ##### What's the \"home folder\"?\n\"Home folder\" refers to the directory where users files are stored (compared to locations where system files are stored, for example). (Ref. Wikipedia: [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory)) In Workspaces, the home folder is `/home/workspace`. Any files in this folder or any subfolder are part of your home folder contents, which means they're saved between sessions and transferred automatically when you switch between CPU/GPU mode.\n<br><br>\nThe folder `/tmp` is _not_ in the home folder; files in any folder outside your home folder are **not** persisted between sessions or transferred between CPU/GPU mode. You can create a folder outside the home folder using the command `mkdir` from a terminal. For example you could create a temporary folder to store data using `mkdir -p /data` to create a folder at the root directory. You will need to recreate the folder and recreate any data inside every time you start a new Workspace session.\n\n- ### Keeping your connection alive during long processes\nWorkspaces automatically disconnect when the connection is inactive for about 30 minutes, which includes inactivity while deep learning models are training. You can use the workspace_utils.py module [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/May/5b0dea96_workspace-utils/workspace-utils.py) to keep your connection alive during training. The module provides a context manager and an iterator wrapper—see example use below.\n<br><br>\n**NOTE:** The script sometimes raises a connection error if the request is opened too frequently; just restart the jupyter kernel & run the cells again to reset the error.\n<br><br>\n**NOTE:** These scripts will keep your connection alive while the training process is _running_, but the workspace will still disconnect 30 minutes after the last notebook cell finishes. Modify the notebook cells to **save your work** at the end of the last cell or else you'll lose all progress when the workspace terminates.\n\n**Example using context manager:**\n```python\nfrom workspace_utils import active_session\n\nwith active_session():\n    # do long-running work here\n```\n\n**Example using iterator wrapper:**\n```python\nfrom workspace_utils import keep_awake\n\nfor i in keep_awake(range(5)):\n    # do iteration with lots of work here\n\n```\n\n- ### Manage your GPU time\nIt is important to avoid wasting GPU time in Workspace projects that have GPU acceleration enabled. The benefits of GPU acceleration are most useful when evaluating deep learning models—especially during _training_. In most cases, you can build and test your model (including data pre-processing, defining model architecture, etc.) in CPU mode, then activate GPU mode to accelerate training.\n\n- ### Handling \"Out of Memory\" errors\nThis issue isn't specific to Workspaces, but rather it is an apparent issue between Pytorch & Jupyter, where Jupyter reports \"out of memory\" after a cell crashes. Jupyter holds references to active objects as long as the kernel is running—including objects created before an error is raised. This can cause Jupyter to persist large objects in memory long after they are no longer required. The only known solution so far is to reset the kernel and run the notebook cells again.",
