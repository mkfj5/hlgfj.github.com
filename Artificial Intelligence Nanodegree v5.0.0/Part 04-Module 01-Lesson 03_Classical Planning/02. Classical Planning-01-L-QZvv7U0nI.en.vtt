00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
Now I want to describe a notation which we call classical planning which is

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.340
a representation language for dealing with states and actions and plans.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.090
And it's also an approach for dealing with the problem of

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.500
complexity by factoring the world into variables.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.805
So under classical planning the state space consists of all the possible assignments to

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:30.150
k-boolean variables and so that

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.050
means they'll be two to the case states in that state space.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.420
And if we think about

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.685
the two location vacuum world we would have three boolean variables.

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.645
We could have dirt in location A,

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:52.745
dirt in location B and vacuum in location A.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.245
And the vacuum has to be in either A or B.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:01:01.643
So these three variables will do and they'll be eight possible states in that world,

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:05.935
but they can be succinctly represented through the three variables.

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:09.660
And then World State consists of

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.275
a complete assignment of true or false through each of the three variables.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.590
And then a belief state.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.020
Well, just as in problem

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.890
solving the belief state depends on what type of environment you want to deal with.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.380
Now in the core classical planning the belief state had to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.095
be a complete assignment and that was useful for dealing with deterministic,

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:37.770
fully observable domains, but we can easily extend

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.860
classical planning and we can deal with belief states that are partial assignments.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.045
That is some of the variables have values and others don't.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:54.270
So we could have the beliefs state consisting of vacuum in A is true and the others are

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.870
unknown and that small formula represents four possible world states.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
And we can even have a belief state which is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.843
an arbitrary formula in boolean logic and that can represent anything we want.

00:02:10.843 --> 00:02:12.630
So that's what states look like.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.730
Now we have to figure out what actions

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.905
look like and what the results of those action looks like.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.530
And these are represented in classical form,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.525
classical planning by something called an action schema,

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.180
and it's called the schema because it represents

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.575
many possible actions that are similar to each other.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:34.020
So let's take an example of,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.910
we want to send cargo around the world

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.870
and we've got a bunch of planes in airports and we have cargo and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.205
so on and I'll show you the action for having a plane fly from one location to another.

00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.201
Here's one possible representation.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:52.050
We say it's an action schema so we write the word action and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.485
then we write the action operator and its arguments.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:06.750
So it's a fly of P from X to Y and then we list the preconditions.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.177
What needs to be true in order to be able to execute this action,

00:03:11.177 --> 00:03:15.750
and we can say something like well P better be plane,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.585
it's no good trying to fly a truck or a submarine.

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:24.885
And then we'll use the end formula

00:03:24.885 --> 00:03:30.804
from Boolean propositional logic and X better be an airport.

00:03:30.804 --> 00:03:33.830
We don't want to try to take off from my backyard.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.975
Similarly Y, that'd would be an airport.

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:43.195
And most importantly P better be at airport X in order to take off from there.

00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:48.240
And then we represent the effects of the action by saying,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.665
well what's going to happen?

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.305
Well once we fly from X to Y,

00:03:53.305 --> 00:04:01.490
the plane is no longer at X so we say not at P,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:08.790
X, plane's no longer at X, and the plane is now at Y.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.700
So this is called an action schema.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.065
It represents a set of actions for all possible planes,

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:16.550
for all X and for all Y,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.655
represents all those actions in one schema that says what we need to know in order

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:25.460
to apply the action and it says what will

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.141
happen in terms of the transition from state spaces,

00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:33.585
this variable will become false and this one will become true.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:35.825
Now, when we look at this formula,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:40.745
this looks like a term in first order logic,

00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:45.485
but we're actually dealing with completely propositional world.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:48.980
It just looks like that because this is a schema and we can

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.225
apply this schema to specific ground states,

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:58.640
specific world states, and then P and X would have specific values and you could just

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.260
think of it as concatenating their names all

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.363
together and that's just the name of one variable.

00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:09.320
The name just happens to have this complex form with parentheses and commas in it to

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.000
make it easier to write one schema that covers all individual fly actions.
