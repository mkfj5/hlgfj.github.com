00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.248
Here's a map where we've
colored in two regions for you.

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:05.040
Given this state in the map coloring,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.250
propagate through the constraints to
make each variable arc consistent.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.880
Check the boxes to indicate which
color is possible in each region.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.129
Finally, is the entire
network arc consistent?
