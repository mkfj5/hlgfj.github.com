00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.710
Our next optimization
is forward checking.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.650
Basically for each unassigned variable.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.290
We are going to keep track of
the remaining legal values.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.080
&gt;&gt; I get it.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.789
So, if we ever make a decision that
causes an unassigned variable to not be

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.139
able to have a value.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.929
We stop our search and back up.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.449
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.899
&gt;&gt; Let's try that with
the Australia example.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.599
We start with nothing colored and

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.460
all the regions could have
any of the three colors.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.429
&gt;&gt; In our first step we assign
orange to Western Australia.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.449
That removes orange from the colors
available to the Northern Territory and

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.929
to Southern Australia.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.380
&gt;&gt; Suppose we assign
green to Queensland.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.640
Now both the Northern Territory and
Southern Australia can only have blue.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.670
And New South Wales can have orange or
blue.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.840
If we assign blue to Victoria.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290
&gt;&gt; Then we see that New South Wales
can only have orange.

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.589
The northern territory can only have blue
and south australia can't have anything.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290
&gt;&gt; So, we figured out that we are stuck.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.000
And can back track earlier than
we would have if we tried to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.969
continue assigning variables.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.659
&gt;&gt; Exactly, forward checking
is a early warning system

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.539
that a search is going
down the wrong branch.
