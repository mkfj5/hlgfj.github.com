00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.920
So which algorithm are we going
to show first to solve constraint

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.230
satisfaction problems?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.259
&gt;&gt; Well the stupid one first of course.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.359
&gt;&gt; I had to ask.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.490
&gt;&gt; Then we'll add
intelligence as we need it.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.199
&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll use simple search.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.660
States are defined by
the values assigned so far.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.720
&gt;&gt; The initial state is
the empty assignment.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.320
First we'll check to see if
the current assignment is the goal.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.120
&gt;&gt; Then we will assign a value to
an unassigned variable that does not

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.960
conflict with the current assignment.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.160
&gt;&gt; We call it a dead end if
there are no legal assignments.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.660
In that case, we will back up
to the previous state, and

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.160
try another assignment.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.539
&gt;&gt; And we recurse until we
either find the answer or

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.500
try all the possible assignments and
report failure.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.740
&gt;&gt; Let's make the algorithm
concrete by doing an example.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:41.259
Here's our map of Australia.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.724
&gt;&gt; We will work with
western Australia first.

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:47.439
&gt;&gt; We could have one of three colors,
orange, green or blue.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:48.659
&gt;&gt; I'll choose orange.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:49.579
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.939
What section do you want
us to look at next?

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:53.719
&gt;&gt; How about the northern territory.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.310
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.076
Since we chose orange for western
Australia, for northern territory,

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.439
can have two colors, green or blue.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:01.649
&gt;&gt; Let's choose green.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.349
&gt;&gt; Okay, now let's work with Queensland
next, it can be orange or blue.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:07.559
&gt;&gt; Let's choose blue.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.010
&gt;&gt; But now we are in trouble, there
are no colors left for South Australia.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.450
&gt;&gt; Okay, well that's a dead end,
let's back up and try the other branch,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.109
where we only used orange and
green up to this point.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.489
&gt;&gt; And eventually we'll find
the answer this way, but

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:23.059
we can improve the efficiency
of the algorithm significantly.
