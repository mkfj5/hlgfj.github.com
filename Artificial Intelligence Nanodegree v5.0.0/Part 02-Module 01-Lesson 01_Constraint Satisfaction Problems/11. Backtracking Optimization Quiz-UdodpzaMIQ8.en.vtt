00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's consider the optimizations
we just discussed.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.553
For this half colored map,

00:00:04.553 --> 00:00:08.121
which region should we fill in next
in order to minimize backtracking?

00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:09.515
There might be multiple answers here.

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:11.370
But choose one of these
optimizations and

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280
choose the region that
matches with that.
