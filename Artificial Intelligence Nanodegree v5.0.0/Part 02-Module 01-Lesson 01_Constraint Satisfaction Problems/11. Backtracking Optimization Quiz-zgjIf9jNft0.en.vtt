00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
Here are two possible answers.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.390
This region is holding a green
region and an orange region, so

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.110
it only has two options for colors.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.760
Compared to all other regions,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.075
this is the minimum remaining
values of those regions.

00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:14.915
For this region,

00:00:14.915 --> 00:00:18.555
we can pick the least constraining
value which is green in this case.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:22.095
Because its bordering region can
only take light blue or dark blue.

00:00:22.095 --> 00:00:25.395
So avoiding those two choices
gives us more options later on.
