00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.380
However, I noticed we could've
stop our search earlier.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; How?

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.800
&gt;&gt; At this step we said the Northern
Territory in South Australia

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.280
both had to be blue.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt; So?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.880
&gt;&gt; But this two regions are adjacent.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.960
We know they can't both be blue.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.180
&gt;&gt; I see, for checking propagates
information from assigned to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.940
unassigned variables but doesn't provide
early detection from all failures.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.020
Instead, we can use constraint
propagation repeatedly to enforce all

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.650
the local constraints.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.210
&gt;&gt; We can use Arc Consistency for

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.730
a simple version of
constraint propagation.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.070
A variable, and a constraint
satisfaction problem is arc consistent,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.050
with respect to another variable, if
there is some value still available for

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.320
the second variable, after we assign
a value to the first variable.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.090
If all variables in a graph
satisfies this condition,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.520
then the network is arc consistent.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.490
&gt;&gt; Let's look at the practical example.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.310
Once we get to the stage of signing
green to Queensland we look at

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.122
of its neighbors that are unassigned and

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:56.070
see if the assignment of green reduces
the number colors available to them.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.221
If so,
we remove from a neighboring region.

00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:00.981
And then look at its neighboring regions
to see if we need to appropriate

00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:02.120
the change onward.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.300
We keep doing this process
until it terminates or

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.370
we determine that one of the regions
does not have any colors left.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.675
&gt;&gt; So here, we have removed green
from South Australia's list and

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.290
we're now looking at its neighbors.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.680
New South Wales is a neighbor, and
in order to be arc consistent,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.380
we will have to remove blue
from its available colors.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.120
It can only be orange.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.150
&gt;&gt; Victoria is a neighbor
of New South Wales so

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.120
we look to see if the change affects it.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.490
In fact it does.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.680
We remove orange from Victoria's
list of available colors.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.560
Our choice in green for

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.630
Queensland has caused a chain of changes
in possible values for our variables.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.779
&gt;&gt; Why don't we remove blue,
while we're at it so

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.162
Victoria doesn't conflict
with South Australia?

00:01:39.162 --> 00:01:42.530
&gt;&gt; Well, we haven't gotten that far
in our queue of things to check yet.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.700
Next, we're going to look at
the Northern Territory because it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.310
has another neighbor that might be
affected by South Australia's change.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.720
In fact, we see South Australia and

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.637
the Northern Territory are both
restricted to blue which is not allowed.

00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:55.810
So we return a failure and force
the search to try another option for

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.160
Queensland.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.940
&gt;&gt; Wow, that was a lot of work.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.160
&gt;&gt; But it can save a lot of
unnecessary deep searching for

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.510
more complicated problems.
