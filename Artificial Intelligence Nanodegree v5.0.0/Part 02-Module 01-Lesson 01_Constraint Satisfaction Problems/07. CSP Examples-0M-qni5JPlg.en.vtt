00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.420
Besides unary and binary constraints, we
could have constraints that involve 3 or

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.140
more variables or soft constraints
like the fact that I prefer to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.580
teach on a Tuesday/Thursday schedule.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.358
Problems with preference constraints are
called constraint optimization problems

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:17.640
and are with solving linear programming.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.860
&gt;&gt; There are lots of examples of
constraint satisfaction problems.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.790
Sudoku is a classic game which can be
solved with any of the methods we will

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.640
be teaching.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.860
&gt;&gt; Other examples include car assembly,
job scheduling in factories, class

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.550
scheduling, spreadsheets, transportation
scheduling or floor planning.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.930
Many of these require
real-valued variables.
