00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.559
I guess we've already
seen one optimization.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.200
&gt;&gt; How so?
&gt;&gt; Well, if I choose the least

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.130
constraining value for Queensland,
we would not have had to back up.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.650
Let me show you.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.009
We started with
Western Australia being orange.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.379
Then the Northern territory was green.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.080
Since Queensland is not next to Western
Australia, I can use orange again.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:19.879
That will leave blue unused.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.729
&gt;&gt; Okay, so orange was the value that
least constrained our future choices.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.980
&gt;&gt; Now, you get it.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.620
&gt;&gt; Another optimization is to choose
to assign the variable with a minimum

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.330
remaining values next.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.100
&gt;&gt; If we start with
assigning Western Australia,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.460
then the Northern territory colors, the
variable with the least number of values

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.929
remaining is South Australia, so we
should choose that one next to assign.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.439
&gt;&gt; What if I have a tie?

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:42.679
&gt;&gt; What do you mean?

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:47.229
&gt;&gt; In this example, we have assigned
Southern Australia a Northern Territory.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.640
There are two regions that can be
only assigned orange, Queensland, and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.329
Western Australia.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.739
Which do we chose?

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.039
&gt;&gt; Choose the one with
the most constraints.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.359
&gt;&gt; You mean Queensland in this case
because the border is New South Wales,

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.379
as well as a Northern Territory,
and Southern Australia.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.585
Western Australia, only borders,
Norther Territory in Southern Australia.

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:11.544
So it's not as complex.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.534
By choosing the one that's more
constrained in the future,

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:19.274
we'll appeal to running the problem
sooner rather than delaying them.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:20.135
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:23.590
&gt;&gt; Okay, well how much do these
improvements to backtracking help?

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.350
&gt;&gt; Remember our n queens problem?

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.239
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:29.459
&gt;&gt; Well it is another example of
a constraint satisfaction problem.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:30.469
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.200
&gt;&gt; And
using the least constraining value and

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.840
minimum remaining values heuristics, the
improved backtracking search will allow

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.020
us to do the thousand queens problem.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:39.769
&gt;&gt; I don't think I could
ever do that by hand.

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:40.909
That's impressive.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:41.840
&gt;&gt; You haven't seen anything yet.
