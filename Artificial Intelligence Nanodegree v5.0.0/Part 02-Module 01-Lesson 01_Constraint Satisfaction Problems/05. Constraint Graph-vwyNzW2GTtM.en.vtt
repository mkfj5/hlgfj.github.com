00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.980
Anyway, unary constraints restrict
the value of a given variable,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.190
like saying Tasmania can't be purple.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.950
&gt;&gt; Binary constraints relate,
at most, two variables.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.310
We can represent those
with a constraint graph.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.740
&gt;&gt; Here's a constraint graph for
our Australia coloring problem.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.684
Nodes are the variables,
like Western Australia,

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:22.090
South Australia, Queensland, etc.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.690
Arcs show the constraints
between the variables.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.497
&gt;&gt; We can apply general-purpose
constraint satisfaction problem

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:30.566
algorithms to the graph structure to
speed up our search for an answer.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.750
For example, Tasmania is independent
from the rest of the problem.
