Here's the answer.

00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:06.160
We have several islands on this map, so
they can have any of the three colors.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.003
However, K2 is constrained
to only one color, green,

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.570
because of the two bordering regions.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.758
Finally, the entire
network is arc consistent,

00:00:13.758 --> 00:00:16.265
because we don't have any regions
without a possible color.
