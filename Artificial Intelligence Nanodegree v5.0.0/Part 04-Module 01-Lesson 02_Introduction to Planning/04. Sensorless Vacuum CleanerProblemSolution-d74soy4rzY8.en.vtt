00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
The answer is, that the state of knowing that

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.570
your current square is clean corresponds to this state,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.465
this belief state with four possible world states.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:14.730
If I then execute the right action followed by the sack action,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.785
then I end up in this belief state,

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:18.450
and that satisfies the goal.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.060
I know I'm in the right hand side location and I know that location is clean.
