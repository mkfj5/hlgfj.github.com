00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.430
So let's say we perform that search,
we had a big search tree, and

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:07.019
then we threw out all
the branches except one.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.629
And this branch of the search tree
does itself have branches, but

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.850
this branch of the search tree,
through the belief state,

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.269
represents a single plan,
not multiple possible plans.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.704
Now what I want to know is, for

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.619
the single plan,
what can we guarantee about it?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.280
So, say we wanted to know is this
plan guaranteed to find the goal

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.470
in an unbounded number of steps?

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.839
And what do we need to guarantee that?

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.060
So it's an unbounded solution.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.500
Do we need to guarantee that
some leaf node is a goal?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.979
So for example,
here the plan it goes through and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.890
at the bottom there's a leaf node.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.799
Now if this were in problem solving,

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.329
then remember it would be a sequence
of steps with no branches in it.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.277
And we know it's a solution if
the one leaf node is a goal.

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:05.319
But for these other branches, do we need
to guarantee that some leaf is a goal?

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:11.579
Or do we need to guarantee
that every leaf is a goal?

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.759
Or is there no possible guarantee
that will mean that for

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.780
sure we've got a solution, although
the solution may be of unbounded length.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.730
And I also want you to answer,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.890
what does it take to guarantee
that we have a bounded solution?

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.069
That is a solution that is
guaranteed to reach the goal

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:33.924
in a bounded finite number of steps.

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:39.590
Do we need to have a plan that has
no branches in it, like this branch?

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.780
Or a plan that has no loops in it,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.439
like this loop that goes
back to a previous state?

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.769
Or is there no guarantee that
we have a bounded solution?
