00:00:01.548 --> 00:00:04.407
Here's a state space diagram for
a simple problem.

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:07.294
It involves a room with two locations,

00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:10.960
the left we call A and
the right we call B.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.910
And in that environment there's
a vacuum cleaner, and there may or

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.623
may not be dirt in either
of the two locations.

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:20.500
And so that gives us eight total states.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.283
Dirt is here, or not here, or not, and
the vacuum cleaner is here or here.

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:29.960
So that's 2 times 2 times
2 is 8 possible states.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.820
And I've drawn here the states based
diagram with all the transitions for

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.000
the three possible actions.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.619
And the actions are moving right, so
we'd go from this state to this state.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.309
Moving left,
go from this state to this state.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.940
And sucking up dirt we go from this
state to this state, for example.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.579
And in this state space diagram,

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.519
if we have a fully deterministic, fully
observable world, it's easy to plan.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.360
Say we start in this state and

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.850
we want to end up in a goal state
where both sides are clean.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.340
We can execute the suck dirt action and
get here, and then move right, and then

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.850
suck dirt again, and now we end up in
a goal state where everything is clean.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.150
Now, suppose our robot vacuum
cleaner's sensors break down.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.900
And so, the robot can no longer proceed
neither which location it's in or

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.670
whether there's any dirt.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.680
So we now have an unobservable,
or centralist,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.890
world rather than
a fully observable one.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.980
And how does the agent then
represent the state of world?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.350
Well, it could be in any
one of these eight states.

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:38.729
And so all we can do to represent
the current state is draw a circle or

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.760
box around everything, and say,
I know I'm somewhere inside here.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.950
Now, that doesn't seem
like it helped very much.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.689
What good is it to know that we
don't really know anything at all?

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.469
But the point is that we can search
in the state space of belief states

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.590
rather than in the state
space of actual spaces.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.990
So we believe that we're in one
of these eight states, and now,

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.769
when we execute an action, we're
going to get to another belief state.

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:06.104
Let's take a look at how that works.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:11.019
