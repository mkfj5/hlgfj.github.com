00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
This is the belief state space for the sensorless vacuum problem.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.540
So we started off here.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.310
We drew the circle around this belief state,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.560
so we don't know anything about where we are.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.080
But the amazing thing is if we execute actions,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.330
we can gain knowledge about the world even without sensing.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.570
So let's say we move right.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.310
Then we'll know we're in the right-hand location.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.495
Either we were in the left and we moved right and arrived there,

00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:28.415
or we were in the right to begin with and we bumped against the wall and stayed there.

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:31.278
So now we end up in this state.

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:33.610
We now know more about the world.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.720
We're down to four possibilities rather than eight,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.650
even though we haven't observed anything.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.403
And now, note something interesting,

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:41.640
that in the real world,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.975
the operations of going left and going right are inverses of each other,

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.757
but in the belief state world,

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:49.048
going right and going left are not inverses.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.809
If we go right and then we go left,

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.530
we don't end up back where we were in a state of total uncertainty.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.650
Rather, going left takes us over here,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.545
where we still know we're in one of four states rather than in one of eight states.

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.450
Note that is possible to form a plan that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.071
reaches a goal without ever observing the world.

00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:12.670
Plans like that are called conformant plans.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.600
For example, if the goal is to be in a clean location,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.245
all we have to do is suck.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.174
So we go from one of these eight states to one of these four states,

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:24.986
and in every one of those four,

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:26.860
we're in a clean location.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.725
We don't know which of the four we're in,

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:31.020
but we know we've achieved the goal.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
It's also possible to arrive at a completely known state.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.369
For example, we start here.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.090
We go left. We suck up the dirt there.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.065
We go right and suck up the dirt.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:46.014
Now we're down to a belief state consisting of one single state,

00:01:46.014 --> 00:01:48.396
that is we know exactly where we are.

00:01:48.396 --> 00:01:50.675
Here's a question for you.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:52.530
How do I get from the state where I know

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.964
my current square is clean but know nothing else,

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:58.380
to the belief state where I know that I'm in

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.605
the right-hand-side location and that that location is clean?

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:05.719
What I want you to do is click on the sequence of actions - left,

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.820
right, or stuck - that will take us from that start to that goal.
