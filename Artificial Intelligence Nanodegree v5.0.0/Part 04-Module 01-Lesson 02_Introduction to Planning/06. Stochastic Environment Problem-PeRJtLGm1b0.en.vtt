00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.960
Now let's move on to
stochastic environments.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.740
Let's consider a robot that
has slippery wheels, so

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.359
that sometimes when you make a movement,
a left or

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.349
a right action, the wheels slip and
you stay in the same location.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.480
And sometimes they work and
you arrive where you expected to go.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.990
And let's assume that the suck
action always works perfectly.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.949
Now, we get a belief state space
that looks something like this.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.349
And, notice that the results of actions

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.679
will often result in a belief state
that's larger than it was before.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.219
That is, the action will increase
uncertainty because we don't know

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:35.629
what the result of
the action's going to be.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.609
And so here, for
each of the individual world states

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.119
belonging to a belief state, we have
multiple outcomes for the action.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:45.709
And that's what stochastic means.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.750
And so we end up with
a larger belief state here.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.240
But in terms of the observation,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.000
the same thing holds as in
the deterministic world.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.179
The observation partitions the belief
state into smaller belief states.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.584
So, in a stochastic partially
observable environment,

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:05.361
the actions tend to
increase uncertainty, and

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.911
the observations tend to bring
that uncertainty back down.

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.340
Now, how would we do planning
in this type of an environment?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.454
Well, I haven't told you yet, so
you won't know the answer for sure.

00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:17.469
But I want you to try to
figure it out anyways,

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.230
even if you might get the answer wrong.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.165
So, imagine I had the whole belief state
from which I've diagrammed just a little

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:24.819
bit here.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.533
And I wanted to know how to get from
this belief state to one in which all

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.930
squares are clean.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.449
So I'm going to give you
some possible plans, and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.420
I want you to tell me whether you think
each of these plans will always work,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.590
maybe sometimes work depending on
how the stochasticity works out.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.799
And so here are the possible plans,
remember I'm starting here, and I want

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.959
to know how to get to a belief state
in which all the squares are clean.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:58.000
One possibility is suck right,
then suck.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.549
One is right suck, left suck.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.549
One is suck right, right suck.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.210
And the other is suck right,
suck right, suck.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.129
So some of these actions might take you
out of this little belief state here.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.280
But just use what you knew from the
previous definition of the state space

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.400
and the results of
each of those actions.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.879
And the fact that the right and
left actions are non-deterministic.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.889
And tell me which of these you
think will always achieve the goal.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.069
Or will maybe achieve the goal.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.449
And then I want you to also answer for
the fill in the blank plan.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.129
That is, is there some plan,
some ideal plan, which always or

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.180
maybe achieves the goal?
