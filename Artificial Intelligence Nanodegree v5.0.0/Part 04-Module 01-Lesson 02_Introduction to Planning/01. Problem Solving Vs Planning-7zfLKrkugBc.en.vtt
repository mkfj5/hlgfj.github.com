00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.480
You remember our problem solving work.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.049
We have a state space like this and

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.849
we're given a start space and
a goal to reach and

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.989
then we'd search for a path to find
that goal and maybe we find this path.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.560
Now, the way a problem solving agent
would work is first it does all the work

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.789
to figure out the path to
the goal just doing by thinking.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.739
And then start to execute
that path to drive or

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.899
walk or however you want to get there
from the start state to the end state.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.439
But think about what would happen
if you did that in real life?

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.289
If you did all planning ahead of time,
you have a complete goal and

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.269
then, without interacting
with the world,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.400
without sensing it at all you
started to execute that path.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.899
Well, this has in fact been studied.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.699
People have gone out and blind folded,
walkers put them in the field and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.040
told them to walk in a straight line and
the results are not pretty.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.659
Here are the GPS tracks to prove it.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.719
So we take a hiker, we put him at
a start location, say here, and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.569
we blindfold him so that he can't
see anything in the horizon, but

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.849
just has enough to see his or
her feet so that they

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.250
won't stumble over something, and tell
them, execute the plan of going forward.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.689
Put one step in front of each other and
walk forward in a straight line.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480
And these are the typical paths we see.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.840
Start out going straight for awhile,
but then go in loopty-loops and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.070
end up not on a straight path at all.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.579
These ones over here, starting in this
location, are even more convoluted,

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.060
going straight for a little bit and
then going very tight loops.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.879
So people are incapable of
walking a straight line

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.289
without any feedback
from the environment.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.240
Now here on this yellow path,
this one did much better.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.719
Why was that?

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.909
Well it's because these paths
were on overcast days and so

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.769
there was no input to make sense of.

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.560
Whereas this path was
on a very sunny day.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.420
So even though the hiker couldn't see
farther than a few feet in front of him.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.189
He could see shadows and

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.280
say, as long as I keep the shadows
pointing in the right direction.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.570
Then it can go in
a relatively straight line.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.758
So more or less, we need some
feedback from the environment.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:12.599
We can't just plan ahead and
come up with a whole plan.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.379
We've got to intervene planning and
executing.
