00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.540
Here's an example of tracking
the predict update cycle.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.961
And this is in a world in which
the actions are guaranteed to work

00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:09.138
as advertised.

00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:12.689
That is, if you suck,
you clean up the current location, and

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.602
if you move right or left, the wheels
actually turn and you do move.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:21.063
But, we can call this the kindergarten
world because there are little

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:25.759
toddlers walking around who can deposit
dirt in any location at any time.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.300
So, if we start off in this state,
and execute the suck action,

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:36.719
we can predict that we'll end up
in one of these two states.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810
Then if we have an observation,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.719
well we know what that
observation's going to be.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.171
Because we known the suck action always
works, and we know we were in A.

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:48.928
So the only observation we can get is
that we're in A and that it's clean,

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.250
we end up in that same belief state.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.840
And then if we execute the right action,
well then lots of things could happen.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.630
Because we move right and somebody
might have dropped dirt in the right

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.769
location and somebody might have dropped
dirt in the left location or maybe not.

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:09.599
And so
we end up with four possibilities, and

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.500
then we can update again when
we get the next observation.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.822
Say if we observed that plan B and

00:01:16.822 --> 00:01:20.262
it's dirty then we end
up in this belief state.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:22.131
And we can keep on going,

00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:27.930
specifying new belief states as result
of successive predicts and updates.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.670
Now, this predict update cycle gives
us a kind of calculus of belief states.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.500
That can tell us really
everything we need to know.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.349
But there is one weakness with this
approach, is that as you can see here,

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.780
some of the belief states
start to get large.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.650
And this is a tiny little world,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.124
already we have a belief state
with four world states in it.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:54.354
We could have one with 8,16,1024,
whatever.

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:59.118
And it seems that there maybe more
succinct representations of a belief state

00:01:59.117 --> 00:02:02.269
rather than to just list
all the role states.

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:03.659
For example, take this one here.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.669
If we have divided the world up not
into individual world states but

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.180
into variables describing that state.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.030
Then this whole belief state
could be represented just by

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.000
vacuum is on the right.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.629
So the whole world could be represented
by three states or three variables.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.900
One, where is the vacuum?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.550
Is it on the right or not?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.300
Secondly, is there dirt
in the left location?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.250
And third,
is there dirt in the right location?

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.180
And we can add some formula over
those variables to describe states.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.780
And with that type of formulation
some very large states, in terms

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.189
of enumerating the world states, can be
made small in terms of the description.
