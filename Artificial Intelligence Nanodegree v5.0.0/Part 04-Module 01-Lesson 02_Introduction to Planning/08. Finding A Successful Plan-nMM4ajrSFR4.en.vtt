00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.730
Now I've told you what
a successful plan looks like, but

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.599
I haven't told you how to find one.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:07.830
The process of finding it can be done
through a search just as we did in

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.970
problem solving.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.190
So remember in problem solving
we start off in a state, and

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.330
it's a single state,
not a belief state.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.260
And then we start searching a tree.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.820
And we have a big triangle of possible
states that we search through.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.460
And then we find one pair that gets
us all the way to a goal state.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.551
And we pick from this
big tree a single path.

00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:37.191
So with the least states and with
branching plan structures we do the same

00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:42.230
sort of process only the tree is
just a little bit more complicated.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:48.229
So here we show one of these trees,
and it has different possibilities.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.759
So for example we start off here and

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.909
we have one possibility that the first
action will be going right or

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.899
another possibility that the first
action will be performing a suck.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.500
But then it also has branches
that are part of a plan itself.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.109
So this branch here is actually
part of a plan as we saw before,

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:11.150
it's not a branch in the search space,
its a branch in the plan.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.230
So what we do is we search through this
tree, we try right as a first action,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.359
we try suck as a first action, we keep
out expanding nodes, until we find

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.539
a portion of the tree, like this path
is a portion of this search tree.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.700
We find that portion,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.460
which is a successful plan according
to the criteria of reaching a goal
