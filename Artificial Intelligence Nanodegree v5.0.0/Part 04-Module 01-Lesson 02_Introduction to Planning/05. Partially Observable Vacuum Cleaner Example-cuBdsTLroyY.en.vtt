00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.830
We've been considering sensorless
planning in a deterministic world.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.379
Now, I want to turn our attention to
partially observable planning, but

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.279
still in a deterministic world.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.536
Suppose we have what's
called local sensing.

00:00:11.537 --> 00:00:14.868
That is our vacuum can see
what location it is in, and

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:18.201
it can see what's going on
in the current location,

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:22.719
that is whether there's dirt in
the current location or not.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.718
But it can't see anything about whether
there's dirt in any other location.

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:31.917
So here's a partial diagram of the part
of the belief state from that world,

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:37.649
and I wanted to show how the belief
state unfolds as two things happen.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.589
First, as we take action.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.940
So we start in this state, and
we take the action of going right.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.169
And in this case,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.689
we still go from two world states in
our belief state to two new ones.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:56.669
But then, after we do an action,
we do an observation.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420
We have the act-percept cycle, and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.899
now once we get the observation,
we can split that world.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.828
We can split our belief state to say if
we observe that we're in location B and

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:11.755
it's dirty, then we know we're
in this belief state here,

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:15.161
which happens to have exactly
one world state in it.

00:01:15.162 --> 00:01:19.192
And if we observe that we're clean then
we know whether we're in this state,

00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:20.931
which also has exactly one in it.

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:26.004
Now, what is the act-observe cycle do
to the sizes of the belief states?

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.540
Well, in a deterministic world, each
of the individual world states within

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.729
a belief state maps into
exactly one other one.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.689
That's what we mean by deterministic.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.349
And so that means the size of the belief
state will either stay the same, or

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:43.049
it might decrease if two
of the actions sort of

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.679
accidentally end up bringing
you to the same place.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.810
On the other hand the observation
works in kind of the opposite way.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.810
When we observe the world, what we're
doing is we're taking the current

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.750
belief state and
partitioning it up into pieces.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.590
Observations alone can't introduce a new
world state into the belief state.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.698
All that can do is say some of them
go here and some of them go here.

00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:13.310
Now, maybe, that for some observation,
all the belief states go into one bin.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.270
And so we make an observation and
we don't learn anything new.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.352
But at least the observation can't make
us more confused than we were before

00:02:20.352 --> 00:02:21.385
the observation.

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:30.008
