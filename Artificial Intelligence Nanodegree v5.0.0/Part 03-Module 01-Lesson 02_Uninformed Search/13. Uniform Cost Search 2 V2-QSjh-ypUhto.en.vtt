00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.035
Of the three paths on the frontier,

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.019
we have ones with cost of 146,

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.250
140, and 118 and that's the cheapest.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.810
So this one gets expanded,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.550
we take it up to frontier,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.545
move it to explored,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.960
add in its successors.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.679
In this case it's only one and that has a path total of 229.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.539
Which path do we expand next?

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.155
Well, we got 146, 140, and 229.

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.594
So 140 is the lowest,

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:34.939
take it up frontier,

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.649
put it on explored,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.619
add in this path,

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.544
the total cost 220,

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:44.385
add this path with total cost 239,

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:46.350
and now the question is,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.149
which path do we expand next?
