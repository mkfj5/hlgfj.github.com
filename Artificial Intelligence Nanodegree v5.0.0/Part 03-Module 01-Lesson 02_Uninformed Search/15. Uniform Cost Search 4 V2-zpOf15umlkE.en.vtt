00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.520
The answer is this one,

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.939
220 is less than 229 or 239.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.605
Take it out the frontier,

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.509
put it on the explored,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.539
add in two more pairs and sum them up.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.519
So 220 plus 146 is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:28.869
366 and 220 plus 97 is 317.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.530
Now notice that we're closing in on Bucharest.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.855
We've got two neighbors almost there,

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:38.679
but neither of them is their turn yet.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.454
Instead, the cheapest path is this one over here.

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:44.710
So move it to the explored list,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.265
add 70 to the path costs so far and we get 299.

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:59.789
Now the cheapest node is 239 here, so we expand.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.534
Finally, hint to Bucharest at a cost of 460,

00:01:05.534 --> 00:01:08.729
and now the question is, are we done?

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.829
Can we terminate the algorithm?
