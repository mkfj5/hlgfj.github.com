00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:01.190
So we move on.

00:00:01.191 --> 00:00:03.910
We look for another shortest path.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.291
There's one path left of length one,
so we look at that path, we expand it.

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:14.900
Add in this path,
put that one on the explored list.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.039
And now we've got three
paths of length two.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.710
We choose one of them.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.989
And let's say we choose this one.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:29.269
Now, my question is,
show me which states we add to the path.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.399
And tell me whether we're going to
terminate the algorithm at this point

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.399
because we've reached the goal, or
whether we're going to continue.
