00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.339
The answer is no, we're not done yet.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.214
We have reached the goal state.

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:10.859
We put a path onto the frontier that reaches the goal,

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.969
Bucharest, but we haven't popped that path off the frontier.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.719
An uniform cost search continues to search until we pop it off the frontier.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.669
We continue looking to see if there's a better path that also reaches the goal.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.110
So let's see, I forgot to say Fagaras is explored,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.769
so let's continue looking on the frontier.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.939
The cheapest now is here at 299, we'll expand that.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:40.684
We get a path across 374,

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.429
put that on the frontier.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.255
Now let's go again.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:49.234
Now the cheapest path is over here at 317.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:53.314
We'll mark that as explored and add two more paths,

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:56.780
one here, that's a worst path, so it gets dropped,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.290
and one path that also reaches the goal and that has a total cost of 418.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.609
So that just shows it's a good thing we waited,

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.140
a good thing we didn't stop when we found the first path to the goal,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.870
because now this second path found is actually cheaper than the first path found.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.380
But we're not going to stop here because we still haven't

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.929
popped off a path that reaches the goal.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.235
So we'll continue. What's next?

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:30.219
Now the cheapest path on the frontier is here at 366.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.579
We expand that and we get the path that

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.120
are worst paths to points we've already seen before.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.140
So nothing new goes on the frontier.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.795
Next, the cheapest path on the frontier is at 374.

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:48.310
Again, expanding that leads nothing useful,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.290
only worse paths than we've seen before.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.045
Now finally, that's cheapest path on the frontier is this 418 path,

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:00.355
the Bucharest, so we pop that off.

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:01.920
Now we reach the goal,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.355
and now we stop.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:06.665
So even though we found the 460 path first,

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:09.290
we don't stop there because there might be

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.019
another path that also reaches the goal that's cheaper.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.960
We keep on going until we popped path off of the frontier that reaches the goal.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.090
That's why uniform cost search is guaranteed to find the cheapest path to the goal.
