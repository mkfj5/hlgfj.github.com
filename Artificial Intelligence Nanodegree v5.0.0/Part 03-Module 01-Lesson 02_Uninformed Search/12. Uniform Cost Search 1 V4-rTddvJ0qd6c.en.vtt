00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.434
Cheapest-First says that we pick the path with the lowest total cost,

00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:09.115
and that would be this path.

00:00:09.115 --> 00:00:11.000
It has a cost of 75,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.690
compared to the cost of 118 and 140 for the other paths.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.439
So we get here,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.320
we take that path off the frontier,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.774
put it on the explored list,

00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:24.864
add in its neighbors,

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:26.979
not going back to a rod,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.109
but adding in this new path,

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.719
summing up the total cost of that path,

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:38.545
71 plus 75 is 146 for this path.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.179
Now the question is,

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.310
which path gets expanded next?
