00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.410
The answer is that we add one more path,
the path to Bucharest.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.359
We don't add the path going back
because it's in the explored list, but

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.619
we don't terminate yet.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.239
True, we have added a path
that ends in Bucharest but

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.789
the goal test isn't applied when
we add a path to the Frontier.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.259
Rather it's applied when we remove
that path from the Frontier, and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.170
we haven't done that yet
