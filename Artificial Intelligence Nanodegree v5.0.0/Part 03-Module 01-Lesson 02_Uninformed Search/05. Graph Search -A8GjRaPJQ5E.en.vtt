00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.089
Now we see how to modify
the tree search function and

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.990
make it be a graph search function
to avoid those repeated paths.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.839
What we do is we start off and
initialize the set,

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.179
called the explored set,
of states that we've already explored.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.590
Then, when we consider a new path,

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.678
we add the new state to the set
of already explored states.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.550
And then,
when we're expanding the path and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.713
adding in new states to the end of it,
we don't have that end,

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:35.079
if we've already seen that new state
in either the frontier or the explored.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.179
Now back to Breadth-First Search, and

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.590
let's assume we're using
the graph search so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.500
that we've eliminated the duplicate
path, Arad is crossed off the list.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.109
The path that goes from Arad to
Sibiu back to Arad is removed, and

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.920
we're left with these one, two,
three, four, five possible paths.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.900
Given these five paths, show me which
ones are candidates to be expanded next

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.055
by the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
