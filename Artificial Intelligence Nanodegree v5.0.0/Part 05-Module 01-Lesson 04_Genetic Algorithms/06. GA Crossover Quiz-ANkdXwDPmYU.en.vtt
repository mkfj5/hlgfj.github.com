00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.710
Try to apply what you've learned so

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.780
far to complete this iteration
of the genetic algorithm.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.110
First, fill in the fitness value or the
number of non attacking pairs of queens

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.600
for each board state in
the initial population.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.780
Then, choose parents according
to their fitness score and

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.310
fill them in this column.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.140
Order them by fitness value
where the best is on top.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.949
Now cross over the top
two selected parents,

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.660
making sure that they're
different individuals.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.440
Then produce two children using a four,
four split.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.140
Finally, fill in the fitness values for
the resulting children.
