00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.640
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.620
Note that the children are worse
than some of the parents.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.460
In progressive generations,
we might continue to see this.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.140
But with mutation step,
we might get closer to the goal.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.310
Without the mutation step,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.360
we run the risk of never
actually reaching the goal.
