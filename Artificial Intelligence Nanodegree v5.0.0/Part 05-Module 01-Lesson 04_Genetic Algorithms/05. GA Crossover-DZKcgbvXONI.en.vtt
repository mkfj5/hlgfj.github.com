00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay, let me handle this one.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.540
Given a parent 32752411.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.109
Which corresponds to a board
that looks like this.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.769
We've randomly selected the spot
between the third and fourth column.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.539
To be the crossover point.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.419
For the first child, we'll take
the first part of the first parent.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.920
Which we'll mark in blue.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:21.609
Looking at the second parent.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:28.009
Which is 24748552,
we're going to take the last part of it.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.800
Let's mark that in yellow.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.990
And now we'll add them together,
to get a child that is 32748552.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.070
That makes more sense to me now that I
see it done with the actual game boards.
