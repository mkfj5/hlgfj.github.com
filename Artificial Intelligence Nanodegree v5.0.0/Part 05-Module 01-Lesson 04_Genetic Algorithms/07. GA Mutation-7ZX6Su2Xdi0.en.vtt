00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.569
But there is one problem,

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.710
what if there's a critical part of the
solution that is none of the parents?

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:07.929
&gt;&gt; That could be an issue.

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:10.330
Could also imagine that a critical piece

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.439
might be in a board that never
gets selected as a parent.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.379
Like poor number 4 here, and

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.510
that critical piece gets bred out in
the early stages and never comes back.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.710
How do we handle it?

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.039
&gt;&gt; More randomness.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.050
&gt;&gt; How so?

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.929
&gt;&gt; Just like we have
mutations in biology,

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.929
we're going to use mutations
in genetic algorithms.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.750
For each digit,
I'm going to have a small but

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.380
significant chance that the digit
will mutate into some other digit.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.290
In the first child,
the five changes into a one.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.600
The second child does not
have any mutations and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.620
the third and
fourth children each have one mutation.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:45.539
&gt;&gt; So this mutation step is like
occasionally choosing a random direction

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.979
in simulated annealing
&gt;&gt; Or

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.429
the randomness in
stochastic beam search.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.640
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.700
&gt;&gt; And given enough generations and
mutations,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.690
we expect to get the desired answer?

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:55.409
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.479
And one of the things often reported
in genetic algorithms papers

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.519
is how many generations are needed
until we get a good answer.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Now that we've seen all the components

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.420
of genetic algorithms,
it seems like a good time for a quiz.
