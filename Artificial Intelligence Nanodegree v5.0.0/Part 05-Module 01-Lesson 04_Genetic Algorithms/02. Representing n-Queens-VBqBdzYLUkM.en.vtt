00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.880
We're going to use the n-Queens problem
again to talk about genetic algorithms,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.170
but before we do that, we need to create
a convention to represent a given board.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.790
&gt;&gt; We'll use the one in the book.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.740
Since there can only be one queen in
each column, we can encode a board

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.640
with the number per column that
indicates where the queen is.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.062
So for this board,

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:24.758
the encoding would

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:30.032
be 86427531.
