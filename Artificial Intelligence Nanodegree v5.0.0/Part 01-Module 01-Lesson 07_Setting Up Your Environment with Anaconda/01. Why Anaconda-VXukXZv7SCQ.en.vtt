00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.395
A lot of times, you'll be working with projects that require different library versions,

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:07.310
or different versions of Python even.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.165
In my experience and many other people's,

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:14.940
it's really difficult to get all these versions to play nicely together on one computer.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.685
To solve this problem, we use virtual environments,

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:21.019
managed with libraries such as virtualenv.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.855
Virtual environments let you separate libraries required by different projects,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.330
so you can avoid conflicts.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.625
If you're working with data though,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.405
Anaconda is the way to go.

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:37.625
Anaconda is a distribution of libraries in softwares specifically built for data science.

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.490
It comes with conda,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.205
a package and environment manager that will make your life a thousand times better.

00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:47.170
Now, I'll show you a bit about using conda.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.984
I generally create a new environment for each project I start,

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.715
this way, I can keep the necessary package versions separate.

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:57.965
For example, if I want to start a new project using Python 3,

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:00.305
which you should be using for all new projects,

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:02.819
I can create an environment for it.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.345
Type in conda create.

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:12.680
Give it a name tea_facts.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.725
But that tea_facts about T,

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:18.923
and the Python version 3,

00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:26.234
and Enter.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:27.730
This will create the environment for me.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:36.593
Now, I can enter the environment like so, source activate tea_facts.

00:01:36.593 --> 00:01:39.515
This is the command on Mac and Linux,

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.100
on Windows is just activate.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.445
Now, I'm in the environment,

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:46.085
you can see the name in the prompt.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:49.190
And you can see here, the packages that are installed.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.185
These are just the default packages.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:54.870
Now, I can start installing what I want for this project.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.800
Let's install NumPy and pandas for working with

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.340
the tea data and matplotlib for making visualizations.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.180
Then I'll install Jupyter Notebooks,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:33.099
which I like to use to develop code.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:42.870
And again, looking at the install packages,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.505
I have all these ready to use for my project.

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.240
And these are separated from other environments.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.535
So, I won't run into any conflicting conversion issues.

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:55.820
Okay. Now it's your turn to learn how to use conda for your own projects.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.000
This lesson will take around 30 minutes up to an hour. Have fun.最新课程跟课件还有一对一辅导请加wx：udacity6
